## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The project implements a digital collectible card game with blockchain integration, organized around three core systems:

## Faction Architecture
Seven distinct factions form the core gameplay system:
- Solaris: Light/energy manipulation with predictive algorithms
- Umbral: Shadow operations and information warfare
- Neuralis: Mind control and consciousness networking
- Aeonic: Time/space manipulation mechanics
- Infernal: Risk/reward sacrifice mechanics  
- Primordial: Growth and evolutionary systems
- Synthetic: Mechanical optimization and efficiency

Key implementation: frontend/src/data/factions/index.ts

## Blockchain Integration Layer
Multi-chain NFT operations system supporting:
- Card minting across Ethereum, Etherlink, and Solana
- Cross-chain asset transfers with ownership validation
- Marketplace operations with faction-specific metadata
- Transaction outbox pattern ensuring operation consistency

Key implementations:
- backend/services/blockchain_service.py
- backend/services/blockchain_handler.py

## Game Mechanics System
Specialized gameplay mechanics including:
- Resource management (Energy, Momentum)
- Grid-based battlefield positioning
- Faction-specific ability activations
- Crisis event modifiers
- Cross-faction synergy detection

Key implementation: frontend/features/battlefield/Battlefield.tsx

The architecture emphasizes faction identity preservation across both gameplay and blockchain systems, with specialized handling for NFT metadata and cross-chain operations.
