## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


Crisis Unleashed implements a digital card game with unique faction-based mechanics and blockchain integration. The core business logic is organized around three main systems:

## Core Game Mechanics
- Seven distinct factions (Solaris, Umbral, Neuralis, Aeonic, Infernal, Primordial, Synthetic) each with unique abilities and mechanics
- Dual resource system (Energy and Momentum) for card play and ability activation
- Hexagonal battlefield grid with territory control mechanics
- Turn-based gameplay with specialized phases (Draw, Energy, Main, Combat, End)

File paths:
- `src/components/game/TurnManager.tsx`
- `src/features/battlefield/Battlefield.tsx`
- `src/types/game.types.ts`

## Blockchain Integration
- Transaction outbox pattern for consistent NFT minting and transfers
- Multi-chain support (Ethereum, Etherlink, Solana) with provider abstraction
- Health monitoring system for blockchain services
- Feature flag system for gradual rollout of blockchain features

File paths:
- `backend/services/blockchain_handler.py`
- `backend/services/blockchain_service.py`
- `backend/repository/transaction_outbox.py`

## Faction System
- Unique mechanics per faction (e.g., Solaris energy manipulation, Umbral stealth)
- Cross-faction synergy system with power scaling
- Progressive faction advancement through "Universal Program" paths
- Crisis events that modify gameplay based on faction alignment

File paths:
- `src/data/factions/index.ts`
- `src/components/factions/FactionGridWrapper.tsx`
- `.neuralliquid-ai/FACTION_SYSTEM.md`

The business logic emphasizes faction interactions, strategic resource management, and secure blockchain integration for digital asset ownership. Feature flags enable gradual rollout of new components while maintaining backward compatibility through middleware routing.
