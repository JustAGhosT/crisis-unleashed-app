## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The Crisis Unleashed project implements a complex card game with blockchain integration, organized around several core business domains:

## Core Game Systems

### Faction Mechanics
- Seven unique factions with distinct technological approaches and abilities
- Faction-specific resource systems and combat mechanics
- Custom validation rules for faction interactions and synergies

File paths:
- `frontend/src/components/factions/`
- `backend/types/faction.py`

### Card System
- Hero-based combat with specialized card types
- Multi-resource management (Energy, Momentum)
- Faction-specific card abilities and effects
- NFT integration for card ownership

File paths:
- `frontend/src/features/cards/`
- `backend/services/blockchain_handler.py`

## Blockchain Integration

### Transaction Management
- Outbox pattern for blockchain consistency
- Support for multiple chains (Ethereum, Etherlink, Solana)
- NFT minting and trading workflows
- Custom validation for blockchain operations

File paths:
- `backend/repository/transaction_outbox.py`
- `backend/services/blockchain/`

### Asset Generation
- Faction-based placeholder asset generation
- Dynamic SVG content generation
- Custom faction-themed patterns
- Hierarchical asset generation workflow

File paths:
- `frontend/scripts/generate-placeholder-assets*.cjs`

## Game State Management

### Combat System
- Phase-based turn system
- Zone-based battlefield control
- Initiative-based combat resolution
- Resource regeneration rules

File paths:
- `frontend/src/features/battlefield/`

### Health Monitoring
- Service dependency management
- Critical service validation
- Custom health check implementations
- Fail-fast initialization system

File paths:
- `backend/services/health_manager.py`

The business logic emphasizes faction identity, strategic depth through resource management, and secure blockchain integration while maintaining game balance and consistency.
