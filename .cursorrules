## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The project implements a faction-based gaming portal with distinct business domains:

### Asset Generation System
Core asset generation pipeline handles faction-specific visual elements:
- Faction emblems with unique thematic patterns
- Background generators incorporating faction aesthetics
- Effect systems for visual treatments
- Icon generation with faction-specific attributes

File paths:
- `frontend/scripts/generate-placeholder-assets.cjs`
- `frontend/scripts/generate-placeholder-assets-part2.cjs`
- `frontend/scripts/generate-placeholder-assets-part3.cjs`

### Faction System Architecture
Seven distinct factions with unique mechanics:
- Solaris Nexus: Energy manipulation
- Umbral Eclipse: Stealth warfare 
- Aeonic Dominion: Time manipulation
- Primordial Genesis: Adaptation systems
- Infernal Core: Risk/reward mechanics
- Neuralis Conclave: Mind control systems
- Synthetic Ascendancy: Tech evolution

### Game Mechanics Framework
Structured turn system with:
- Resource management (Energy/Momentum)
- Phase-based turns (Deploy/Action/End)
- Combat resolution system
- Crisis event handling
- Card type hierarchy:
  - Hero cards
  - Unit cards (melee/ranged/siege/flying)
  - Action cards
  - Structure cards

File paths:
- `frontend/src/features/battlefield/TurnManager.tsx`
- `frontend/src/features/cards/CardHand.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/CrisisEvent.tsx`

### Status Management
Backend system for tracking game status:
- Status check creation and retrieval
- Client tracking
- Timestamp management

File paths:
- `backend/server.py`

### Multiplayer Framework
- Ranked/casual matchmaking
- Tournament systems
- Social features (friends, spectate, guilds)

The architecture emphasizes faction-specific implementations while maintaining balance through distinct strengths and weaknesses for each faction.
