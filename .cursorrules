## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


## Core Business Systems

### Game Mechanics Engine
- Complex turn-based system with phases: Draw, Energy, Main, Combat, End
- Resource management (Energy/Momentum dual system)
- Battlefield grid system with zone control mechanics
- Combat resolution with faction-specific modifiers

File paths:
```
frontend/src/features/battlefield/Battlefield.tsx
frontend/src/features/battlefield/TurnManager.tsx
```

### Faction System
- Seven unique factions with distinct mechanics and abilities
- Faction-specific resource manipulation and combat rules
- Technology integration system affecting universal program outcomes
- Cross-faction interaction rules and synthesis mechanics

File paths:
```
frontend/src/utils/factionUtils.ts
frontend/src/theme/factionThemes.ts
```

### Blockchain Integration
- Transaction outbox pattern for database-blockchain consistency
- Multi-chain support (Ethereum, Etherlink) with provider abstraction
- NFT minting and transfer operations with faction-specific metadata
- Marketplace operations with blockchain-specific implementations

File paths:
```
backend/services/blockchain_service.py
backend/repository/transaction_outbox.py
```

### Service Health Management
- Critical service dependency resolution
- Fail-fast initialization for essential services
- Continuous health monitoring with status reporting
- Service availability validation with dependency checks

File paths:
```
backend/services/health_manager.py
```

### Feature Flag System
- Progressive rollout of new components
- Faction-specific feature toggling
- User-group based feature activation
- Analytics tracking for feature adoption

File paths:
```
frontend-next/src/lib/feature-flags/feature-flag-provider.tsx
frontend-next/middleware.ts
```
