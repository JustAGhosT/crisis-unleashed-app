### Core Game Component Data Flow

Major components participate in the following data flow paths:

1. Battlefield -> TurnManager
- Hex grid state updates on unit placement/movement
- Zone control status changes
- Unit position matrices 
- Combat resolution outcomes
Importance Score: 85

2. CardHand -> PlayerHUD
- Card selection state
- Energy/resource availability checks
- Playable card validation
- Hand size monitoring
Importance Score: 80

3. TurnManager -> GameInterface
- Turn phase transitions
- Action point updates
- Valid action broadcasts
- Turn completion signals
Importance Score: 90

4. PlayerHUD -> Battlefield
- Resource state for action validation
- Unit deployment requests
- Combat initiation signals
- Zone activation triggers
Importance Score: 85

5. Battlefield -> CardHand
- Valid placement zone updates
- Unit interaction possibilities
- Combat opportunity signals
- Tactical option availability
Importance Score: 75

Key State Update Patterns:
- Circular validation between components for action legality
- Cascading updates for resource consumption
- State synchronization for multiplayer actions
- Event-driven UI updates based on game state changes

Component Responsibilities:
- Battlefield: Maintains game board state, handles unit positioning
- CardHand: Manages player card states and interactions
- GameInterface: Coordinates component communication
- PlayerHUD: Tracks player resources and status
- TurnManager: Controls game flow and action sequencing
