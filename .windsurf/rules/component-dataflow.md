Core Data Flow Implementation:

1. Battle State Flow
- Battlefield -> TurnManager: Combat phase transitions, unit positioning updates
- TurnManager -> PlayerHUD: Resource updates (energy/momentum), turn phase indicators
- CardHand -> Battlefield: Card deployment requests, targeting validation
- PlayerHUD -> GameInterface: Player state updates, resource availability

2. Deck Building Flow
- CardBrowserPanel -> DeckEditorPanel: Card selection events
- DeckEditorPanel -> DeckStats: Real-time deck composition updates
- DeckStats -> DeckBuilder: Validation state and deck metrics
- CardDetailsPanel -> DeckBuilderInterface: Card preview and inspection data

Key Data Flow Patterns:

1. Combat Resolution Flow:
```
Battlefield
  → TurnManager (phase control)
    → PlayerHUD (resource updates)
      → CardHand (playability updates)
        → Battlefield (deployment)
```

2. Deck Construction Flow:
```
CardBrowser
  → DeckEditor (card selection)
    → DeckValidator (rule checking)
      → StatsCalculator (metrics update)
        → Interface (feedback)
```

State Update Rules:
- Combat state updates require TurnManager validation
- Resource updates flow through PlayerHUD before reaching CardHand
- Deck modifications trigger cascading validation updates
- Battlefield position changes update unit interaction possibilities

Critical Paths:
/components/game/Battlefield.tsx
/components/game/TurnManager.tsx 
/components/game/PlayerHUD.tsx
/components/deck-builder/DeckBuilder.tsx

Importance Score: 85/100
