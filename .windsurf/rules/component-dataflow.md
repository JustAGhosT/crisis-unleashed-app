## Core Game Component Data Flow

The game's component data flow centers around five major components that manage the game state:

### Battlefield -> TurnManager
- Sends unit position updates and combat results
- Notifies when units enter/exit zones of control
- Transmits terrain effect applications
Importance Score: 85

### TurnManager -> PlayerHUD
- Broadcasts current phase (deploy/action/end)
- Updates available actions and energy
- Signals turn transitions
Importance Score: 80

### CardHand -> Battlefield
- Initiates card deployment requests
- Transmits targeting information
- Sends card effect triggers
Importance Score: 90

### GameInterface -> All Components
- Manages global game state updates
- Coordinates cross-component effects
- Handles faction-specific rule applications
Importance Score: 95

### PlayerHUD -> CardHand
- Updates available energy for card plays
- Signals card play restrictions
- Manages hand size limits
Importance Score: 75

## State Update Flow

1. Card Play Sequence:
- CardHand validates energy cost
- TurnManager verifies legal play timing
- Battlefield processes unit placement
- PlayerHUD updates resources

2. Combat Resolution:
- Battlefield calculates unit interactions
- TurnManager validates combat timing
- PlayerHUD updates unit status
- GameInterface applies faction effects

3. Turn Transition:
- TurnManager signals phase change
- PlayerHUD refreshes resources
- CardHand draws new cards
- Battlefield updates control zones
