## Core Architecture Components

### Faction Theme System (90)
`frontend-next/src/lib/theme/faction-theme.ts`
- Dynamic theme generation for 7 unique factions
- Theme tokens affect UI elements, card styling, battlefield visuals
- Faction-specific color palettes, typography rules, and visual treatments

### Game State Management (85) 
`frontend-next/src/lib/deck-builder/deck-builder-context.tsx`
- Centralized state for deck building, battlefield, and game progression
- Turn phase tracking with distinct deploy/action/end states
- Resource pool management for energy and momentum
- Hand and deck state synchronization

### Battlefield Interface (80)
`frontend-next/src/components/game/Battlefield.tsx`
- Hex-grid based combat system with custom positioning logic
- Zone control visualization and territory mechanics
- Unit placement and movement validation
- Combat resolution display system

### Deck Building Interface (85)
`frontend-next/src/components/deck-builder/DeckBuilderInterface.tsx`
- Faction-aware deck construction rules
- Real-time deck validation
- Card quantity limits by rarity
- Resource curve analysis

### Feature Flag System (75)
`frontend-next/src/lib/feature-flags/feature-flag-provider.tsx`
- Controls UI feature rollout
- Environment-aware flag configuration 
- User role-based feature access
- A/B testing support for UI components

### Real-time Game Updates (80)
`frontend-next/src/lib/realtime/connection.ts`
- WebSocket-based game state sync
- Action validation and conflict resolution
- Reconnection handling with state recovery
- Turn timer synchronization

### Card Collection Management (70)
`frontend-next/src/components/cards/CardCollection.tsx`
- Player card ownership tracking
- Collection completion statistics
- Card acquisition history
- Favoriting system

The architecture emphasizes faction-specific theming, real-time gameplay, and complex state management for the card game mechanics. Core business logic is concentrated in the faction system, deck building rules, and battlefield mechanics.
