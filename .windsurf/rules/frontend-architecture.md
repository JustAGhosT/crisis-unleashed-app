# frontend-architecture

COMPONENT HIERARCHY:
1. Root Layout (`FactionThemeRoot.tsx`)
- Manages global faction-specific theming
- Coordinates faction-based visual styles and animations
- Handles faction relationship status effects

2. Deck Builder System:
- DeckBuilderClient.tsx: Core deck construction engine
- DeckBuilderInterface.tsx: Manages deck validation rules
- CardBrowserPanel.tsx: Implements card filtering by faction/type
- DeckStats.tsx: Calculates deck metrics and balance scores

3. Faction Management:
- FactionsThemeShell.tsx: Controls faction-specific UI adaptations
- FactionDetail.tsx: Displays faction mechanics and relationships
- MoodBoard.tsx: Visualizes faction aesthetic and thematic elements

STATE MANAGEMENT PATTERNS:

1. Deck Building Context
```typescript
interface DeckBuildingState {
  selectedFactions: FactionType[]
  cardCounts: Record<CardId, number>
  heroCards: CardType[]
  resourceCurve: ResourceDistribution
}
```

2. Faction Theme Context
```typescript
interface FactionThemeState {
  primaryFaction: FactionType
  secondaryFaction?: FactionType
  themeTokens: FactionVisualTokens
  relationshipStatus: FactionRelationship[]
}
```

CORE BUSINESS COMPONENTS:

1. Deck Validation Engine
Path: frontend-next/src/lib/deck-builder/deck-builder-context.tsx
- Enforces deck construction rules:
  - Maximum 3 copies per card
  - 30-50 cards per deck
  - Maximum 2 factions
  - Required hero cards
  - Faction compatibility checks

2. Faction Relationship Manager
Path: frontend-next/src/lib/theme/faction-theme.ts
- Calculates inter-faction synergies
- Manages faction opposition effects
- Controls faction-specific ability modifications
- Handles relationship status changes

Importance Score: 85/100
