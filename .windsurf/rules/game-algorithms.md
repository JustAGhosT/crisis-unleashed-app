Core Game Systems:

1. Battlefield Management (Importance: 95)
- Hex-based grid combat system with 3 lanes
- Zone of Control (ZoC) implementation affecting unit movement
- Terrain effects modifying combat and movement
- Unit positioning rules based on range and control zones
- Custom pathfinding with faction-specific movement costs

2. Turn Sequencing (Importance: 90)
- Multi-phase turn structure:
  * Deploy Phase: Unit placement with position validation
  * Action Phase: Combat and ability activation
  * End Phase: Status effect resolution and resource updates
- Energy/Momentum resource accumulation
- Initiative-based combat resolution
- Crisis event triggers and effects

3. Combat Resolution (Importance: 85)
- Multi-step combat sequence:
  1. Initiative check (modified by unit types)
  2. Range validation
  3. Damage calculation with faction modifiers
  4. Status effect application
  5. Death resolution
- Faction-specific combat modifiers
- Unit ability triggers during combat
- Battlefield position effects on combat

4. Card Deployment Logic (Importance: 80)
- Position validation based on card type
- Resource cost verification (Energy/Momentum)
- Faction-specific deployment rules
- Unit type placement restrictions
- Synergy calculations with existing battlefield state
