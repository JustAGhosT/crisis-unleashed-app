## Core Systems

### Battlefield Management (90/100)
`frontend-next/src/components/game/Battlefield.tsx`
- Hex-based grid combat system with axial coordinates
- Zone of control mechanics affecting movement and engagement
- Custom movement cost calculations based on terrain and unit type
- Line of sight and range calculations for abilities
- Unit facing and flanking mechanics

### Card Deployment Logic (85/100)
`frontend-next/src/lib/card-utils.ts`
- Faction-specific placement restrictions
- Resource cost validation (energy, momentum)
- Target validity checking for card effects
- Prerequisite verification for combo cards
- Unit stacking and formation rules

### Turn Sequencing (80/100) 
`frontend-next/src/components/game/TurnManager.tsx`
- Phase management (deploy, action, end)
- Action point economy system
- Initiative-based turn order
- Energy/momentum resource tracking
- Crisis event triggers

### Combat Resolution (85/100)
`frontend-next/src/lib/hex.ts`
- Attack range and line of sight checks
- Damage calculation with faction modifiers
- Status effect application and duration tracking
- Counter-attack opportunity validation
- Unit persistence after combat

### Faction Mechanics (90/100)
`frontend-next/src/lib/theme/faction-theme.ts`
- Solaris: Solar energy amplification
- Umbral: Stealth and ambush tactics
- Aeonic: Time manipulation effects 
- Primordial: Growth and evolution systems
- Infernal: Risk/reward sacrifice mechanics
- Neuralis: Mind control abilities
- Synthetic: AI/robotics specialization

### Crisis Event System (75/100)
`backend/api/faction_endpoints.py`
- Faction-specific crisis triggers
- Cross-faction interaction rules
- Resource economy modifiers
- Territory control effects
- Victory condition alterations
