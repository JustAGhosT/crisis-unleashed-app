Core Game Models:

1. Card System
```typescript
interface Card {
  id: string
  name: string
  type: CardType // Hero | Unit | Action | Structure
  rarity: Rarity // Common | Uncommon | Rare | Epic | Legendary  
  faction: FactionId
  cost: number
  abilities: Ability[]
}
```

2. Battlefield Grid
```typescript
interface BattleGrid {
  cells: Cell[][] // Hexagonal grid implementation
  width: number 
  height: number
  controlZones: ControlZone[]
}

interface Cell {
  position: HexCoord
  terrain: TerrainType
  unit?: Unit
  effects: StatusEffect[]
}
```

3. Player Stats
```typescript
interface PlayerStats {
  health: number // 0-30
  energy: number // 0-10  
  momentum: number // 0-100
  deck: Deck
  hand: Card[]
}
```

4. Game State
```typescript
interface GameState {
  phase: GamePhase // Deploy | Action | Combat | End
  turnPlayer: PlayerId
  battlefield: BattleGrid
  players: Record<PlayerId, PlayerStats>
  crisis?: CrisisEvent
}
```

Key Business Rules:

1. Card Mechanics
- Maximum 3 copies per card in deck
- Legendary cards limited to 1 copy
- Cards require faction energy match to play
- Hero cards unlock special faction abilities

2. Battlefield Control
- Units exert zone control in adjacent hexes
- Control zones generate momentum
- Terrain affects movement and combat
- Maximum 3 units per control zone

3. Resource System
- Energy recharges by 1 per turn up to faction max
- Momentum gained from unit actions and zone control
- Health loss triggers crisis events at thresholds

4. Crisis Events
- Trigger at 10, 15, 20 damage thresholds
- Modify battlefield conditions
- Grant temporary faction bonuses
- Can chain into escalating effects
