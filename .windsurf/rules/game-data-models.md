## Core Game Entities

### Card Model (Importance: 95)
- Implements complex card type hierarchy with unique faction abilities
- Encodes faction-specific mechanics like:
  - Solaris: Energy manipulation and light effects
  - Umbral: Stealth and shadow mechanics  
  - Aeonic: Time manipulation
  - Neuralis: Mind control abilities
  - Synthetic: AI/robotics synergies
- Tracks card state including:
  - Energy cost and requirements
  - Attack/defense values
  - Status effects
  - Targeting rules
  - Valid deployment zones

### Battlefield Grid (Importance: 90) 
- Hex-based coordinate system for positioning
- Zone control mechanics affecting movement
- Resource node placement and control
- Height/terrain influence on combat
- Line of sight calculations
- Unit facing mechanics

### Player Stats (Importance: 85)
- Health tracking (0-30)
- Momentum resource (0-10)
  - Gained through actions
  - Required for special abilities
- Energy pool (0-10 per turn)
  - Faction-specific generation rates
  - Required for card deployment
  - Carried over between turns

### Game State Model (Importance: 90)
- Turn phase tracking:
  - Deploy phase 
  - Action phase
  - End phase
- Initiative system
- Status effect duration tracking  
- Card/unit state management
- Victory condition monitoring

### Combat Resolution (Importance: 85)
- Attack targeting validation
- Damage calculation with:
  - Unit abilities
  - Terrain modifiers  
  - Status effects
- Death/removal handling
- Chain reaction effects

### Resource Management (Importance: 80)
- Energy generation per turn
- Momentum gain from actions
- Resource node control benefits
- Special ability costs
- Card deployment costs
