# Faction System Architecture

## Core Factions

- **Signature Abilities**:
  - Divine Algorithm (3 Energy): Predict and counter opponent's next move
  - Radiant Firewall (4 Energy): Create damage-reflecting barriers
  - System Purge (5 Energy): Remove debuffs and gain immunity

### 2. Umbral Eclipse

- **Theme**: Shadow Tech (Darkness + Information)
- **Key Mechanics**: Stealth, disruption, information warfare
- **Signature Abilities**:
  - Void Protocol (3 Energy): Disable enemy abilities
  - Data Phantom (2 Energy): Create digital clones
  - Neural Parasite (4 Energy): Copy enemy ability

### 3. Aeonic Dominion

- **Theme**: Time Architects
- **Key Mechanics**: Temporal manipulation, board control
- **Signature Abilities**:
  - Chrono Rift (4 Energy): Rewind opponent's last action
  - Quantum Paradox (6 Energy): Create alternate timeline
  - Time Dilation (3 Energy): Slow all enemies

### 4. Primordial Genesis

- **Theme**: Bio-Titans
- **Key Mechanics**: Growth, adaptation, overwhelming force
- **Signature Abilities**:
  - Gaia's Wrath (5 Energy): Massive area attack
  - Adaptive Carapace (3 Energy): Gain damage resistance
  - Titanic Growth (4 Energy): Permanently increase stats

### 5. Infernal Core

- **Theme**: Techno-Demons
- **Key Mechanics**: High risk/reward, sacrifice mechanics
- **Signature Abilities**:
  - Hellfire Overclock (3 Energy): Power boost at HP cost
  - Soulfire Protocol (4 Energy): Sacrifice units for damage
  - Infernal Contract (2 Energy): Draw cards, take damage

### 6. Neuralis Conclave

- **Theme**: Mind Over Matter
- **Key Mechanics**: Mind control, psychic dominance
- **Signature Abilities**:
  - Psionic Storm (4 Energy): Damage based on hand size
  - Mind Meld (3 Energy): Copy opponent's last action
  - Cerebral Overload (5 Energy): Force discard

## Technical Implementation

### Faction Class Structure

```typescript
interface Faction {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  theme: string;
  colorScheme: {
    primary: string;
    secondary: string;
    accent: string;
  };
  abilities: Ability[];
  passiveEffects: PassiveEffect[];
  heroPool: Hero[];
}

interface Ability {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  cost: number;
  effect: (gameState: GameState, target: Target) => GameState;
  cooldown: number;
  description: string;
}
```

### Faction-Specific Systems

1. **Solaris Nexus**: Energy manipulation system
2. **Umbral Eclipse**: Stealth and information systems
3. **Aeonic Dominion**: Time manipulation engine
4. **Primordial Genesis**: Growth and adaptation mechanics
5. **Infernal Core**: Sacrifice and risk/reward systems
6. **Neuralis Conclave**: Mind control and manipulation

## Balance Considerations

- Each faction should have clear strengths and weaknesses
- No single strategy should dominate the meta
- Cross-faction matchups should be balanced
- New content should maintain faction identity while adding depth

## Content Pipeline

1. **Design Phase**: Concept and mechanics
2. **Implementation**: Code and assets
3. **Balance Testing**: Internal and community testing
4. **Iteration**: Based on feedback and metrics
5. **Release**: Documentation and deployment
