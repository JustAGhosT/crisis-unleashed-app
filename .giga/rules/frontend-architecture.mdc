Component Hierarchy

1. Game Core Components
- FactionPortal: Central game interface orchestrating faction interactions and game flow
- GameInterface: Manages turn-based gameplay, resource systems, and battlefield state
- Battlefield: Implements grid-based combat with zone control and positioning mechanics

2. Faction System Components
- FactionGrid: Displays 7 unique factions with distinct visual identities and mechanics
- FactionCard: Renders faction-specific abilities, resource modifiers, and thematic elements 
- FactionDetail: Manages detailed faction interactions and power calculations

3. Combat Mechanics
Location: frontend/src/features/battlefield/
- TurnManager: Orchestrates multi-phase turns with energy/momentum resource management
- CardHand: Handles faction-specific card mechanics and energy cost validation
- BattlefieldGrid: Manages unit placement, frontline/backline positioning, and zone control

4. Resource Management
Location: frontend/src/features/players/
- PlayerHUD: Tracks triple resource system (Health/Energy/Momentum)
- ResourceCalculator: Handles faction-specific resource generation and cost modifiers
- TurnPhaseManager: Controls resource regeneration and phase-based availability

5. Faction-Specific UI Systems
Location: frontend/src/components/factions/
- SolarisInterface: Reality editing field visualization
- UmbralInterface: Shadow manipulation mechanics
- NeuralisInterface: Collective consciousness networking
- AeonicInterface: Time manipulation effects
- InfernalInterface: Blood sacrifice and dimensional rifting
- PrimordialInterface: Evolution acceleration display
- SyntheticInterface: Resource optimization visualization

6. State Management
- FactionThemeContext: Manages faction-specific visual and mechanical attributes
- GameStateProvider: Coordinates battlefield state, turn phases, and resource systems
- CombatResolver: Handles complex faction ability interactions and combat resolution

The architecture implements unique game mechanics through a component hierarchy that maintains faction identity while enabling complex cross-faction interactions and resource management.
