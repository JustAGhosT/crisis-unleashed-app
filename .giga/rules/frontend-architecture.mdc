## Core UI Architecture

### Faction System UI Components (frontend/src/components/factions/)
- Component hierarchy implementing 7 distinct faction interfaces
- Each faction has unique visual themes and interaction patterns:
  - Solaris: Radial layouts with energy visualization
  - Umbral: Shadow-based reveal mechanics  
  - Neuralis: Neural network-inspired connections
  - Aeonic: Time-flow based animations
  - Primordial: Organic growth patterns
  - Infernal: Heat/flame visual system
  - Synthetic: Grid-based mechanical layouts

### Game State Management
- Multi-phase turn system with distinct UI states:
  1. Deploy Phase: Card placement interface
  2. Action Phase: Combat and ability activation
  3. End Phase: Resource reconciliation
- Resource visualization for energy/momentum systems
- Crisis event overlay system for battlefield modifiers

### Battlefield Grid Implementation (frontend/src/features/battlefield/)
- Hexagonal grid system with faction-colored zones
- Unit placement validation with zone control visualization
- Combat resolution animation system
- Crisis event visual effects system

### Progressive Feature System
- Feature flag-based component loading
- Phased rollout architecture:
  1. Core UI components
  2. Faction-specific interfaces
  3. Advanced game mechanics
  4. Social features

### Card Display System
- Faction-specific card templates
- Dynamic stat/ability visualization
- Synergy highlight system for compatible cards
- Special effect system for card combinations

Importance Score: 85/100
- Core game mechanics visualization
- Complex faction-specific interfaces
- Unique battlefield management system
- Custom card interaction patterns
