## Component Hierarchy

### Core Game Components (Importance Score: 95)
- `src/components/game/GameInterface.tsx`: Orchestrates game flow, turn management, and player interactions
- `src/components/battlefield/Battlefield.tsx`: Implements hexagonal grid combat system with zone control
- `src/features/cards/CardHand.tsx`: Manages hand mechanics, card playing rules and resource costs

### Faction System (Importance Score: 90)
- `src/components/factions/`: Houses faction-specific components with unique mechanics
  - Solaris: Divine Algorithm mechanics
  - Umbral: Shadow manipulation system
  - Aeonic: Time control mechanics
  - Primordial: Growth and evolution system
  - Infernal: Risk/reward sacrifice mechanics
  - Neuralis: Mind control abilities
  - Synthetic: Optimization mechanics

### Resource Management (Importance Score: 85)
- `src/features/players/PlayerHUD.tsx`: Tracks faction-specific resources
- Energy system with unique costs per faction
- Momentum tracking for special abilities
- Health/shield management system

### Crisis Events System (Importance Score: 80)
- Real-time event management
- Dynamic battlefield modifications
- Faction-specific crisis responses

### Synergy Visualization (Importance Score: 75)
- Card combination highlighting
- Potential synergy indicators
- Effect chain visualization

### UI/UX Implementation
- Holographic command console theme
- Glassmorphic UI components
- Grid overlay system
- Ambient glow effects
- Faction-specific color schemes
- Interactive tutorials

### State Management Patterns
- Faction state management
- Turn phase tracking
- Resource allocation system
- Card state lifecycle
- Battlefield position tracking
- Crisis event state

## Development Architecture
- Component-based card system
- Real-time game state updates
- WebSocket integration for multiplayer
- Feature flag system for progressive rollout
- Faction-specific asset loading
