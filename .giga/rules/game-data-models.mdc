## Core Game Entities (Importance: 95)

The game defines several core data models that represent the fundamental game mechanics:

### Player Stats Model
- Health points tracking player survival
- Energy points for playing cards each turn 
- Momentum points affecting special abilities
- Current/maximum values for each stat

### Card Model
- Energy cost requirements
- Card effects and abilities
- Target requirements and restrictions
- Card type classification
- Synergy identifiers

### Battlefield Grid Model
- Player and enemy zones
- Unit placement coordinates
- Zone control status
- Movement range limitations
- Line of sight calculations

### Game State Model
- Turn phase tracking (Deploy/Action/End)
- Active player designation
- Crisis event status
- Synergy activation states
- Game phase transitions

File References:
- `frontend/src/types/game.types.ts` - Core type definitions
- `frontend/src/constants/mockCards.ts` - Card data structures

The models are implemented primarily through TypeScript interfaces and constants, with mock data structures providing the initial game state representation for development and testing.
