## Core Game Entities

### Card Models
- Card Types: Hero, Unit, Action, Structure
- Combat Stats: Initiative, Range, Movement Speed
- Resource Costs: Energy, Momentum 
- Zone Restrictions: Backline/Frontline placement rules
- Persistence Rules: Permanent vs temporary effects

### Battlefield Grid
- Layout: 6x4 grid divided into player zones
- Zone Types: Backline (2 rows), Frontline (2 rows)
- Unit Placement: Maximum 1 unit per cell
- Movement Rules: Based on unit movement speed and zone type

### Player Stats
- Health Points: Starting at 30
- Energy: Gained +1 per turn (max 10)
- Momentum: Generated through combat/card effects (max 5)
- Hand Size: 7 cards maximum

### Game State Model
```typescript
interface GameState {
  players: {[id: string]: PlayerState};
  currentPhase: TurnPhase;
  turnNumber: number;
  activePlayer: string;
  battlefield: BattlefieldGrid;
  actionStack: GameAction[];
}
```

### Turn Structure
1. Draw Phase: Draw card
2. Energy Phase: Gain energy
3. Main Phase: Play cards/abilities  
4. Combat Phase: Resolve battles
5. End Phase: Cleanup effects

## File Paths
- `src/types/card.ts`: Card type definitions
- `src/types/game.ts`: Core game state models
- `src/models/battlefield.ts`: Battlefield grid implementation
- `src/data/player-stats.ts`: Player statistics definitions
