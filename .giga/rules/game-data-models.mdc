### Core Game Entity Models

**Player State Model** (Importance: 95)
`frontend/src/components/PlayerHUD.tsx`
- Health points tracking (0-100)
- Momentum resource system
- Energy points for card deployment
- Active/inactive turn status

**Card Model** (Importance: 90)
`frontend/src/types/game.types.ts`
- Card types: character, action
- Properties: name, cost, abilities
- Rarity classification
- Custom effect definitions
- Valid deployment validation rules

**Battlefield Grid** (Importance: 85)
`frontend/src/components/Battlefield.js`
- Deployment zone validation
- Unit positioning tracking
- Card placement restrictions
- Battlefield state management

**Game State Model** (Importance: 95)
`frontend/src/components/GameInterface.tsx`
- Turn phase tracking
- Active player management
- Resource state updates
- Win/loss conditions
- Game phase transitions

**Hand Management** (Importance: 80)
`frontend/src/components/CardHand.js`
- Card selection state
- Affordability validation
- Maximum hand size rules
- Draw/discard mechanics

The game data models form a complete ecosystem tracking the dynamic state of:
- Player resources and status
- Card deployment and effects
- Battlefield unit positions
- Turn sequence and phase management
- Win/loss condition evaluation
