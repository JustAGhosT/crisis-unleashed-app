# === USER INSTRUCTIONS ===
- Layout: 5 × 6 hex grid divided into player zones
- Zone Types: Backline (3 rows), Frontline (3 rows)
- Unit Placement: Maximum 1 unit per hex
- Movement Rules: Based on unit movement speed and hex adjacency (zone type may modify movement costs)

- Hexagonal grid system with the following specifications:
  - Dimensions: 5 columns × 6 rows (30 total hexes)
  - Player Zones: Each player controls 15 hexes (3 rows)
  - Zone Types: 
    - Frontline (3 rows closest to center) - Primary combat area
    - Backline (3 rows farthest from center) - Strategic deployment area
  - Neutral Areas: None in base configuration
  - Occupation Rules: Maximum 1 unit per hex
  - Movement System: Based on unit movement speed attribute and hex adjacency
  - Zone Effects: Different zones may modify movement costs and unit abilities

Key Domain Models:

1. Card System
Path: frontend/src/types/card.ts
- Seven card types: Hero, Unit, Structure, Artifact, Action, Reaction, Enhancement
- Attributes: name, cost, faction, type, rarity, effects
- Keywords system for ability tagging
- Status effect tracking (temporary/permanent)

2. Battlefield Grid
Path: frontend/src/types/battlefield.ts
- 4x4 hex-based grid structure
- Zone control mechanics with line-of-sight calculations
- Terrain modifiers affecting movement and combat
- Position-based effect triggers

3. Player Resources
Path: frontend/src/types/player.ts
- Health (0-20)
- Energy (0-10, gains +1 per turn)
- Momentum (0-5, gained through actions)
- Hand size limits (7 cards maximum)

4. Game State Model
Path: frontend/src/types/game.ts
- Turn phases: Draw, Energy, Main, Combat, End
- Crisis event tracking and resolution
- Victory condition monitoring
- Initiative order management

5. Faction System
Path: frontend/src/types/faction.ts
- Seven distinct factions with unique mechanics:
  * Solaris: Energy manipulation
  * Umbral: Stealth mechanics
  * Aeonic: Time manipulation
  * Primordial: Growth systems
  * Infernal: Sacrifice mechanics
  * Neuralis: Mind control
  * Synthetic: Optimization

6. Status Effects
Path: frontend/src/types/effects.ts
- Duration tracking (turns remaining)
- Stacking rules per effect type
- Faction-specific status interactions
- Priority order resolution

7. Combat Resolution Model
Path: frontend/src/types/combat.ts
- Initiative-based action order
- Range and movement calculations
- Damage application sequence
- Death/removal trigger handling

The models emphasize faction-specific mechanics and their interactions, with complex state tracking for battlefield positioning and resource management. Each faction introduces unique modifications to the base rule set, requiring specialized handling of interactions.
