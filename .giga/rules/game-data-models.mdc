# === USER INSTRUCTIONS ===
- Layout: 5 Ã— 6 hex grid divided into player zones
- Zone Types: Backline (3 rows), Frontline (3 rows)
- Unit Placement: Maximum 1 unit per hex
- Movement Rules: Based on unit movement speed and hex adjacency (zone type may modify movement costs)

Core Game Entity Models:

1. Card Model
File: backend/types/faction.py
```python
class Card:
    faction: FactionType 
    rarity: CardRarity
    energy_cost: int
    momentum_cost: int
    unit_type: UnitType
    combat_stats: CombatStats
    abilities: List[Ability]
```

2. Battlefield Grid
File: frontend/src/types/game.types.ts
```typescript
interface Grid {
    lanes: Lane[]
    zones: Zone[] 
    positions: Position[]
    state: GridState
}
```
- 3x3 grid system with specialized zones
- Front/back line positioning rules
- Zone control mechanics

3. Player Stats
- Health (0-30)
- Energy (0-10, regenerates per turn)
- Momentum (0-5, combat-generated resource)
- Special abilities based on faction alignment

4. Game State
```typescript
interface GameState {
    turn: number
    phase: TurnPhase
    activePlayer: PlayerId
    battlefield: Grid
    hands: {[playerId: string]: Card[]}
    resources: {[playerId: string]: Resources}
}
```

5. Faction-Specific Data Models:
- Solaris: Energy manipulation stats
- Umbral: Stealth mechanics tracking
- Neuralis: Mind control duration tracking
- Aeonic: Time manipulation counters
- Primordial: Growth stage tracking
- Infernal: Sacrifice value calculations
- Synthetic: Optimization metrics

Combat Resolution Model:
- Initiative calculation system
- Damage application order
- Status effect processing queue
- Death resolution handling
- Zone control updates

Resource Management Model:
- Per-turn energy allocation
- Momentum generation tracking
- Special ability cost validation
- Resource decay calculations
