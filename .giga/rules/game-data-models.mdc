### Card Model System (Importance Score: 95)
- Core card entity definition with properties:
  - Combat stats (attack, health, initiative)
  - Resource costs (energy, momentum)
  - Card type categorization (unit, spell, artifact)
  - Faction alignment rules
  - Unique flags and restrictions
File: frontend-next/src/lib/card-utils.ts

### Battlefield Grid System (Importance Score: 90)
- 5 × 6 hex grid layout with distinct zones:
  - Frontline (units must be placed here first)
  - Backline (units can be placed after frontline)
  - Deployment restrictions based on card types
  - Zone control scoring mechanics
File: frontend-next/src/app/sandbox/battlefield-demo/page.tsx

### Player Stats Model (Importance Score: 85)
Core stats tracking:
- Health (0-100)
- Energy (resets each turn, max varies by faction)
- Momentum (accumulates through actions, spent on special abilities)
- Active effects and status conditions
File: frontend-next/src/components/game/PlayerHUD.tsx

### Game State Model (Importance Score: 80)
Turn-based state machine:
- Phase tracking (deploy, action, end)
- Initiative system for unit activation order
- Resource accumulation/spending
- Victory condition monitoring
File: frontend-next/src/types/game.ts

### Deck Construction Rules (Importance Score: 75)
- Deck size limits (40-60 cards)
- Card copy restrictions:
  - Maximum 3x non-unique cards
  - 1x legendary/unique cards
  - Single faction alignment requirement
File: frontend-next/src/lib/deck-builder/deck-builder-context.tsx
