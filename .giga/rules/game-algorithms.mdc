## Core Game Flow Algorithms

### Turn Sequence Management (Importance: 95)
- Located in `/frontend/src/components/GameInterface.tsx`
- Implements state machine for game phases:
  1. Turn initialization with energy reset
  2. Active player designation
  3. Card deployment phase
  4. Combat resolution
  5. Turn transition logic
- Controls momentum and energy resource allocation

### Battlefield Management (Importance: 90)
- Located in `/frontend/src/components/Battlefield.js`
- Handles unit deployment grid system
- Manages valid placement zones based on card types
- Processes unit positioning and movement rules
- Implements proximity-based effect triggers

### Combat Resolution (Importance: 85)
- Located in `/frontend/src/components/Battlefield.js`
- Resolves unit interactions during combat phase
- Applies damage calculations based on unit stats
- Handles special ability triggers during combat
- Processes unit removal on defeat

### Card Deployment Logic (Importance: 80)
- Located in `/frontend/src/components/CardHand.js`
- Validates deployment requirements:
  - Energy cost checks
  - Placement zone availability
  - Card type restrictions
- Handles card selection and deployment confirmation

### Game State Tracking (Importance: 75)
- Located in `/frontend/src/types/game.types.ts`
- Defines core game entities:
  - Card types and abilities
  - Unit stats and modifiers
  - Board state representation
  - Player resource tracking
