## Core Game Systems

### Turn Management
`frontend/src/features/battlefield/TurnManager.tsx`
- Implements distinct turn phases: DEPLOY, ACTION, END
- Manages turn transitions and phase-specific validations
- Handles resource replenishment between turns
Importance: 95

### Card Deployment Logic 
`frontend/src/features/cards/CardHand.tsx`
- Validates card plays based on player energy availability
- Enforces placement restrictions and targeting rules
- Manages hand size limits and card draw sequencing
Importance: 90

### Battlefield Management
`frontend/src/features/battlefield/Battlefield.tsx`
- Controls unit placement across player/enemy zones
- Manages battlefield grid state and zone interactions
- Handles unit positioning validation
Importance: 85

### Game State Orchestration
`frontend/src/components/game/GameInterface.tsx`
- Coordinates overall game flow and phase transitions
- Manages player resources (health, energy, momentum)
- Synchronizes turn-based actions between players
Importance: 92

## Combat Systems

### Unit Interaction
- Manages valid target selection
- Implements zone-based movement restrictions
- Controls unit engagement rules
Importance: 80

### Resource Management
- Tracks and updates player energy pools
- Manages momentum accumulation/expenditure
- Controls resource distribution per turn
Importance: 75
