Core Game Systems:

1. Turn Sequence Engine
Path: backend/types/faction.py
- Phase management system: Draw → Energy → Main → Combat → End
- Energy/Momentum dual resource model with phase-specific rules
- Crisis event triggers and resolution between phases

2. Battlefield Management
Path: frontend/src/features/battlefield/Battlefield.tsx
- Dual-lane system with front/backline positioning
- Zone control mechanics with territory influence
- Unit positioning validation with faction-specific rules

3. Combat Resolution System
Path: backend/types/faction.py
- Initiative-based combat sequencing
- Multi-step resolution: Pre-combat → Combat → Post-combat
- Simultaneous damage application with death handling
- Combat keywords: Quick Attack, Overwhelm, Lifesteal, Shield

4. Faction Mechanics
- Solaris: Predictive algorithm combat modifiers
- Umbral: Stealth and information warfare
- Neuralis: Mind control mechanics
- Aeonic: Time manipulation abilities
- Primordial: Growth and adaptation systems
- Infernal: Sacrifice-based abilities
- Synthetic: Resource optimization

5. Card Deployment Logic
Path: frontend/src/features/cards/CardHand.tsx
- Cost validation against current energy pool
- Position-based deployment restrictions
- Faction alignment requirements
- Hero card special deployment rules

6. Crisis Event System
- Dynamic battlefield modifiers
- Event trigger conditions and resolution
- Cross-faction interaction modifiers
- Resource pool modifications

7. Hero Progression
- Level-based ability unlocks
- Experience gain from combat actions
- Faction-specific advancement paths
- Ultimate ability requirements
