# === USER INSTRUCTIONS ===
- Core combat flow:
  1. Attacker declares target
  2. Keyword ability pre-combat triggers
  3. Combat math resolution with modifiers
  4. Post-combat triggers and state updates

### Core Battle System (Importance Score: 95)
Location: `frontend-next/src/components/game/Battlefield.tsx`
- Grid-based battlefield with distinct zones (frontline, backline, support)
- Zone control mechanics with adjacency bonuses
- Unit placement validation with faction-specific restrictions
- Custom pathfinding for unit movement and targeting

### Card Deployment Logic (Importance Score: 90)
Location: `frontend-next/src/lib/card-utils.ts`
- Energy cost validation against player resources
- Placement zone restrictions based on card type
- Synergy detection between deployed cards
- Multi-target validation for special abilities

### Turn Sequencing (Importance Score: 85)
Location: `frontend-next/src/components/game/TurnManager.tsx`
- Phase system: Deploy, Action, Combat, End
- Resource regeneration between phases
- Action point allocation and spending
- Turn timer with catch-up mechanics

### Combat Resolution (Importance Score: 85)
Location: `frontend-next/src/lib/combat/resolution.ts`
- Initiative-based attack ordering
- Damage calculation with faction modifiers
- Status effect application and stacking
- Death trigger resolution queue

### Faction Mechanics (Importance Score: 80)
Location: `frontend-next/src/lib/faction/mechanics.ts`
- Unique faction abilities:
  - Energy manipulation (Energy faction)
  - Time reversal (Time faction) 
  - Growth accumulation (Growth faction)
  - Sacrifice triggers (Death faction)
  - Mind control duration (Mind faction)
  - Stealth mechanics (Shadow faction)
  - Synthetic combinations (Synthetic faction)

### Card Interaction System (Importance Score: 75)
Location: `frontend-next/src/lib/cards/interactions.ts`
- Chain reaction triggers between cards
- Conditional effect activation
- Response window system
- Priority resolution for simultaneous effects
