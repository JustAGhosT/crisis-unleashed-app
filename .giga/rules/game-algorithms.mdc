# game-algorithms

Core Game Systems:

1. Turn Sequencing
- Three-phase turn structure: Deploy, Action, End
- Resource reset mechanics between phases
- Custom validation for action timing/sequencing
- Phase-specific ability activation rules

2. Combat Resolution
```typescript
// Core combat flow:
1. Attacker declares target
2. Keyword ability pre-combat triggers
3. Combat math resolution with modifiers
4. Post-combat triggers and state updates
```

3. Resource Management
- Dual currency system:
  - Energy: Fixed per-turn allocation (1-10)
  - Momentum: Combat-generated resource (0-5)
- Faction-specific resource modifiers
- Card cost validation against available resources

4. Crisis Event System
- Dynamic battlefield modifiers
- Event countdown mechanics
- Cascading effect resolution
- Impact calculation on game zones

5. Faction Mechanics
- Seven unique faction implementations:
  - Solaris: Energy manipulation
  - Umbral: Stealth/information warfare
  - Neuralis: Mind control
  - Aeonic: Time manipulation
  - Primordial: Growth systems
  - Infernal: Risk/reward
  - Synthetic: Optimization

6. Card Synergy System ("Data-Link")
- Card combination detection
- Faction-based synergy bonuses
- Multi-card effect chains
- Keyword interaction handling

7. Battlefield Management
- Zone control scoring
- Unit positioning validation
- Territory control mechanics
- Multi-zone effect propagation

The algorithms focus heavily on the unique faction-based gameplay mechanics, crisis event system, and dual resource management that defines the core gameplay experience.
