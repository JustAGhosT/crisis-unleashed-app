### Core Game Components Data Flow

#### Battlefield -> TurnManager
- Sends zone control updates and unit position changes
- Notifies when combat phases complete
- Triggers crisis event effects on battlefield state

#### CardHand -> PlayerHUD
- Reports card play attempts and resource costs
- Updates hand size and remaining deck count
- Sends synergy activation events

#### TurnManager -> GameInterface
- Broadcasts current phase and active player
- Sends turn timer updates
- Triggers end-of-turn effects and resets

#### PlayerHUD -> Battlefield
- Transmits resource availability for unit deployment
- Updates zone control indicators
- Sends faction-specific ability activations

### State Update Patterns

#### Crisis Event Propagation
- CrisisManager broadcasts event to all components
- Battlefield updates terrain effects
- PlayerHUD adjusts resource generation
- CardHand modifies card costs/effects

#### Synergy System
- CardHand detects potential synergies
- GameInterface highlights valid targets
- Battlefield shows connection lines
- PlayerHUD updates combo counters

#### Turn Phase Transitions
- TurnManager initiates phase change
- All components receive phase update
- Components enable/disable valid actions
- Resource systems apply phase-specific updates

### Component Communication Channels

#### Direct Updates
- Battlefield -> PlayerHUD: Zone control changes
- CardHand -> TurnManager: Card play attempts
- PlayerHUD -> GameInterface: Resource updates

#### Event Broadcasting
- Crisis events to all components
- Phase changes from TurnManager
- Synergy activations from CardHand
