Core Game Component Interactions:

1. Battlefield → CardHand Flow
Path: frontend/src/features/battlefield/Battlefield.tsx
- Emits zone targeting events for card placement
- Provides zone availability status
- Sends battlefield state updates on card play
- Receives card play intent from CardHand
- Updates zone control status after card resolution

2. CardHand → PlayerHUD Flow
Path: frontend/src/features/cards/CardHand.tsx
- Sends energy cost validation requests
- Emits card selection events
- Receives energy availability status
- Updates hand state on card play
- Tracks card hover/preview states

3. GameInterface → TurnManager Flow
Path: frontend/src/components/game/GameInterface.tsx
- Controls phase transitions
- Manages initiative sequence
- Emits turn events
- Updates global game state
- Handles crisis event triggers

4. PlayerHUD → Battlefield Flow
Path: frontend/src/features/players/PlayerHUD.tsx
- Tracks zone control points
- Updates resource pools
- Emits combat phase readiness
- Manages player status effects
- Syncs battlefield position data

5. TurnManager State Broadcasting
Path: frontend/src/features/battlefield/TurnManager.tsx
- Emits phase change events
- Updates all component states on turn transition
- Manages crisis event resolution flow
- Controls combat sequence timing
- Handles end-of-turn cleanup

Key Data Flows:
- Card Play Sequence: CardHand → PlayerHUD → Battlefield
- Combat Resolution: Battlefield → TurnManager → PlayerHUD
- Resource Management: PlayerHUD → CardHand → GameInterface
- Crisis Events: TurnManager → Battlefield → PlayerHUD

The component interaction system heavily focuses on maintaining game state consistency across the faction-based card game mechanics, with particular emphasis on zone control and resource management.
