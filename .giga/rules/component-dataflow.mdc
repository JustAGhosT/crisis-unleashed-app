### Core Game Component Data Flow

**Battlefield -> TurnManager**
- Sends unit placement events and battlefield state changes
- Notifies when combat phase begins/ends
- Transmits zone control updates
- **Importance Score**: 85

**TurnManager -> PlayerHUD** 
- Updates energy/momentum resources each turn
- Broadcasts turn phase transitions
- Signals when actions are available/unavailable
- **Importance Score**: 80

**CardHand -> Battlefield**
- Transmits card play attempts with targeting data
- Sends unit deployment requests
- Notifies of special ability activations
- **Importance Score**: 90

**GameInterface -> All Components**
- Distributes game state updates
- Manages synchronization of component states
- Routes player actions to appropriate handlers
- **Importance Score**: 85

### State Update Flow

1. Card Play Sequence:
```
CardHand -> GameInterface -> TurnManager (validate) -> Battlefield (resolve) -> PlayerHUD (update)
```

2. Turn Phase Transitions:
```
TurnManager -> GameInterface -> All Components (sync) -> PlayerHUD (update)
```

3. Combat Resolution:
```
Battlefield -> GameInterface -> TurnManager (validate) -> PlayerHUD (update)
```

### Critical Paths

**Resource Management**
- TurnManager maintains source of truth for energy/momentum
- PlayerHUD subscribes to resource updates
- CardHand validates plays against current resources
- **Importance Score**: 85

**Combat State**
- Battlefield owns combat zone state
- TurnManager validates combat timing
- GameInterface synchronizes state across components
- **Importance Score**: 90
