Major component data flows:

1. Battlefield → Card Hand
- Battlefield validates card placement targets based on zone control state
- Sends target validation requests to CardHand before allowing drops
- Updates zone control states when cards are successfully played
- Notifies CardHand of changes to valid play zones

2. TurnManager → GameInterface
- Manages phase transitions (Deploy → Action → End)
- Updates resource pools at phase boundaries
- Broadcasts turn state changes to PlayerHUD
- Validates action timing based on current phase

3. CardHand → PlayerHUD
- Transmits card selection events 
- Updates energy costs and requirements display
- Validates card plays against current resource state
- Notifies of failed validation conditions

4. GameInterface → Battlefield
- Routes player input events to appropriate zones
- Manages targeting system state between components
- Updates visual state based on valid play zones
- Handles unit activation and movement requests

Key State Updates:

1. Resource Management
- TurnManager → PlayerHUD: Energy/Momentum updates
- CardHand → PlayerHUD: Resource consumption events
- Battlefield → PlayerHUD: Zone control bonuses

2. Card State 
- CardHand → Battlefield: Card play attempts
- Battlefield → CardHand: Play validation results
- TurnManager → CardHand: Phase-based play restrictions

3. Combat Resolution
- Battlefield → GameInterface: Combat initiation
- GameInterface → PlayerHUD: Damage resolution
- Battlefield → CardHand: Unit state changes

The data flow architecture emphasizes maintaining consistent game state across components while enforcing the core game rules around energy costs, zone control, and turn phases.
