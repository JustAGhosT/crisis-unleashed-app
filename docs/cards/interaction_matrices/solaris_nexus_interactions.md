# Solaris Nexus Interaction Matrix

This document details the key card interactions and synergies within the Solaris Nexus faction, organized by interaction strength and strategic purpose.

## Core Mechanics

Solaris Nexus interactions primarily revolve around these faction-specific mechanics:

- **Blessing**: Enhancement effects that strengthen units and actions
- **Divine Algorithm**: Card ordering and sequence manipulation
- **Purification**: Removal of enemy effects and corruption
- **Light Energy**: Resource generation and management
- **Alignment**: Positioning and formation advantages

## Prime Synergies

These combinations represent the strongest internal synergies within the Solaris Nexus faction:

### Divine Algorithm Synergies

|--------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Quantum Protocol | Divine Ordering | +++ | Allows player to arrange top 5 cards in any order, then draw 2 |
| Radiant Designator | Algorithm Prime | +++ | Marks cards in opponent's hand, then Algorithm Prime reveals and disrupts them |
| Sequence Adjustment | Ordered Strike | ++ | Sets up exact card sequence for maximum Ordered Strike damage |
| Oracle's Vision | Light's Perfect Form | ++ | Predicts card draws to ensure Light's Perfect Form's condition is met |
| Code Realignment | Algorithm Breach | ++ | Resets own deck order, then uses Algorithm Breach to disrupt opponent's sequencing |

### Blessing Enhancement Chains

| Card 1 | Card 2 | Card 3 | Interaction Level | Effect Description |
|--------|--------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Blessing of Radiance | Lightforged Champion | - | +++ | Doubles Lightforged Champion's blessing bonuses |
| Solar Infusion | Blessing Protocol | Sunrise Guardian | +++ | Creates compounding blessing effects for massive stat gains |
| Radiant Aura | Blessing Network | - | ++ | Spreads blessing to all allied units at enhanced strength |
| Purification Ray | Consecrated Ground | - | ++ | Removes debuffs then applies blessing to all affected units |
| Blessing Transfer | Divine Sacrifice | - | ++ | Moves all blessings to a single unit before sacrifice for massive effect |

### Purification Sequences

| Card 1 | Card 2 | Interaction Level | Effect Description |
|--------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Mass Purification | Light of Renewal | +++ | Cleanses all corruption, then heals based on corruption removed |
| Targeted Cleanse | Purifier's Reward | +++ | Removes specific debuff, then draws cards equal to purification power |
| Void Negation | Solar Restoration | ++ | Neutralizes enemy void effects, then restores resources |
| Purify | Blessing Cascade | ++ | Removes single corruption, triggering blessing effect chain |
| Clean Slate | Order Restoration | ++ | Mass purification followed by board state reorganization |

## Strategic Combinations

These combinations enable specific strategies within the faction:

### Defensive Formations

| Core Cards | Support Cards | Strategy Description |
|------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Light Barrier, Divine Shield, Radiant Defender | Blessing of Protection, Heal Matrix | Creates multi-layered defensive formation with regeneration |
| Algorithm Defense, Predictive Protection, Sequence Guard | Oracle's Vision, Fate Computation | Predicts and negates incoming damage through algorithmic prediction |
| Solar Wall, Light's Reflection, Mirror Force | Radiance Amplifier, Light Convergence | Reflects damage back to attackers with amplification |

### Offensive Pressure

| Core Cards | Support Cards | Strategy Description |
|------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Radiant Strike, Divine Hammer, Light's Judgment | Blessing of Power, Focused Light | Direct damage maximization through blessing enhancement |
| Ordered Advance, Position Prime, Divine Formation | Algorithm Prime, Sequence Manipulation | Optimizes unit positioning for maximum attack efficiency |
| Solar Beam, Light Concentration, Divine Ray | Energy Accumulation, Radiance Collector | Energy-based damage scaling through resource pooling |

### Resource Control

| Core Cards | Support Cards | Strategy Description |
|------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Light Harvester, Energy Reclamation, Divine Conductor | Resource Optimization, Energy Flow | Generates and recycles light energy for sustained casting |
| Algorithm Efficiency, Computational Edge, Processing Advantage | Code Optimization, Sequence Efficiency | Reduces card costs through algorithmic efficiency |
| Solar Network, Distributed Blessing, Resource Sharing | Network Expansion, Grid Optimization | Shares and distributes resources across multiple units |

## Conditional Interactions

These interactions require specific game states or setups to maximize effectiveness:

| Primary Card | Condition | Secondary Card | Effect |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|--------|
| Divine Intervention | < 5 health | Last Hope | Guarantees survival and counterattack opportunity |
| Algorithm Override | 10+ cards played | Computational Singularity | Resets all cooldowns and provides additional actions |
| Perfect Order | All units aligned | Formation Perfected | Applies double blessing and enables special attacks |
| Solar Eclipse | 7+ energy stored | Full Radiance | Converts stored energy to direct damage and board clear |
| Light's Redemption | 3+ corrupted enemy units | Mass Purification | Converts enemy corruption into friendly blessing |

## Counter Synergies

These combinations specifically counter common enemy strategies:

| Enemy Strategy | Counter Cards | Counter Mechanism |
|----------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Corruption Spread | Purification Array, Cleansing Matrix | Mass removal of corruption effects |
| Void Manipulation | Algorithm Stabilization, Reality Anchor | Prevents reality manipulation and glitches |
| Rush Tactics | Light Barrier, Predictive Defense, Divine Shield | Multi-layered protection against early aggression |
| Resource Denial | Energy Independence, Divine Generation | Alternative resource generation pathways |
| Mind Control | Pure Thought, Algorithm Protection | Mental shielding against psychic interference |

## Combo Execution Guide

### Triple Blessing Combo

**Cards Required**: Blessing Initiator, Blessing Cascade, Divine Amplifier

**Execution Steps**:

1. Play Blessing Initiator on your strongest unit
2. Play Blessing Cascade to spread blessing to adjacent units
3. Play Divine Amplifier to double all active blessings
4. Result: Triple-strength blessing on primary target, double blessing on adjacent units

**Counter Points**: Vulnerable to mass dispel effects or corruption; protect with Blessing Protection

### Divine Algorithm Maximum

**Cards Required**: Oracle's Vision, Algorithm Prime, Perfect Sequence, Divine Execution

**Execution Steps**:

1. Play Oracle's Vision to view top 10 cards
2. Play Algorithm Prime to arrange top 5 cards
3. Play Perfect Sequence to draw 3 cards in arranged order
4. Play Divine Execution with perfect setup for maximum effect
5. Result: Perfectly sequenced combo with guaranteed maximum impact

**Counter Points**: Disrupted by deck manipulation; secure with Algorithm Protection

## Anti-Synergies

These Solaris Nexus cards have negative interactions with each other:

| Card 1 | Card 2 | Conflict Description |
|--------|--------|---------------------|
| Random Blessing | Algorithm Prime | Random effects disrupt algorithmic ordering |
| Light Consumption | Energy Conservation | Competing resource mechanics that conflict |
| Individual Glory | Distributed Blessing | Focuses on single unit vs. spreading effects |
| Pure Destruction | Redemptive Light | Opposing philosophy of destruction vs. redemption |
| Absolute Order | Adaptive Response | Rigid order conflicts with adaptation mechanics |
