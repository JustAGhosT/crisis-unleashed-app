# Blessing Interactions

This document details how the Blessing mechanic interacts with various cards, effects, and mechanics across all factions, with special emphasis on Solaris Nexus as the primary faction utilizing this mechanic.

## Blessing Mechanic Overview

Blessing is a positive status effect that typically provides stat enhancements or special abilities to units. Key characteristics:

- **Base Effect**: Typically grants +1/+1 (attack/health) to affected units
- **Duration**: Usually lasts until dispelled or unit leaves play
- **Visual Indicator**: Golden aura surrounding blessed units
- **Stacking**: Most blessing effects can stack up to 3 times on a single unit
- **Source Tracking**: The game tracks which cards applied blessings for interaction purposes

## Blessing and Game Mechanics

How Blessings interact with fundamental game systems:

### Blessing and Combat

- Units deal damage equal to their Attack (including Blessing bonuses)
- Units can survive damage equal to their Health (including Blessing bonuses)
- When calculating combat results, Blessings are always factored into final values
- Blessings do not affect range or attack patterns unless specifically stated
- Combat animations display Blessing auras during attack and defense

### Blessing and Resource Systems

- Blessing effects do not inherently cost or generate energy
- Some cards convert Blessing levels into energy or other resources
- Blessing stacks are tracked as a resource for certain cards' effects
- Blessing levels are preserved when units change control unless specified

### Blessing and Card Types

| Card Type | Interaction Pattern |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Units | Primary target for Blessings, gaining stat increases |
| Actions | Typically apply or manipulate Blessings |
| Conditions | Can modify how Blessings are applied or function |
| Heroes | Can both receive Blessings and generate them |

## Blessing Chains and Combos

These sequences maximize the effectiveness of Blessing effects:

### Triple Blessing Accelerator

**Cards**: Blessing Initiator → Radiant Aura → Divine Amplifier
**Result**: Quickly establishes multiple strong Blessed units for board control

### Blessing Explosion

**Cards**: Blessing Accumulator (3+ turns) → Blessing Transfer → Divine Destroyer
**Result**: Concentrates multiple Blessings for massive burst damage

### Infinite Blessing Loop

**Cards**: Blessing Protocol → Radiant Sequencer → Oracle's Blessing
**Result**: Creates draw engine that generates continuous Blessing application

### Cross-Faction Blessing Combos

These powerful combinations span faction boundaries:

| Combo Name | Cards | Factions | Effect |
|------------|-------|----------|--------|
| Chrono-Blessing | Temporal Echo + Divine Amplifier | Aeonic/Solaris | Creates multiple copies of highly Blessed units |
| Evolved Divinity | Adaptive Blessing + Light's Perfect Form | Primordial/Solaris | Creates evolved super-unit with multiple enhanced abilities |
| Psychic Light | Collective Blessing + Mindlink Network | Neuralis/Solaris | Spreads and amplifies Blessings across all connected units |
| Divine Algorithm | Algorithmic Blessing + Perfect Sequence | Synthetic/Solaris | Optimizes Blessing distribution for perfect strategic advantage |

## Countering Blessing Strategies

Effective ways to handle Blessing-heavy decks:

### Direct Counters

| Card | Faction | Effect | Counter Strength |
|------|---------|--------|-----------------|
| Mass Corruption | Umbral Eclipse | Removes all Blessings and applies Corruption | +++ |
| Reality Shift | Aeonic Dominion | Removes all status effects from all units | ++ |
| Consume Divinity | Primordial Genesis | Destroy a unit and gain stats equal to its Blessing levels | +++ |
| Hellfire Wave | Infernal Core | Damage all units equal to their Blessing levels | +++ |
| Mind Break | Neuralis Conclave | Remove all status effects and prevent new ones for 2 turns | ++ |
| System Reset | Synthetic Directive | Return all units to base stats without enhancements | ++ |

### Strategic Counters

- **Aggression**: Target Blessing-generating units before they can accumulate value
- **Disruption**: Use discard effects to remove Blessing cards from hand
- **Transformation**: Convert enemy units to neutralize their Blessing accumulation
- **Board Clears**: Use mass removal to reset accumulated Blessing investments
- **Redirection**: Use effects that transfer Blessings to your own units

## Rules Clarifications

Common questions about Blessing interactions:

1. **Q: If a unit with multiple Blessings is copied, do the copies have Blessings?**  
   A: Yes, copies receive the same Blessing levels as the original.

2. **Q: Can a unit with maximum Blessings (3) receive additional Blessing effects?**  
   A: The stat bonuses cap at 3 stacks (+3/+3), but additional effects from Blessings can still apply.

3. **Q: Do Blessings affect abilities that check a unit's base stats?**  
   A: No, effects that specifically check "base stats" ignore Blessing bonuses.

4. **Q: If a Blessed unit is transformed, are the Blessings lost?**  
   A: Yes, transformation effects create a new entity without the previous status effects.

5. **Q: Can Blessings be applied to enemy units?**  
   A: Generally no, unless a card specifically states it can target any unit.
