# Interaction Matrix for Card Combos

This document serves as the main index for card interaction matrices, cataloging how cards from different factions and types combine to create powerful synergies and strategies.

## Overview

Card interactions form the strategic foundation of the game, with combinations that can:

- Create powerful emergent effects beyond individual card values
- Enable cross-faction synergies based on mechanical compatibility
- Establish counter-strategies against dominant deck archetypes
- Unlock hidden mechanics that only activate with specific combinations

## Using the Interaction Matrices

Each interaction matrix is organized to help players understand

- Which cards work well together and why
- The mechanical basis for each interaction
- The strategic value of specific combinations
- How to execute multi-card combos effectively
- Ways to counter specific powerful combinations

## Matrix Categories

- [Opposing Forces Synergies](interaction_matrices/opposing_forces_synergies.md) (Solaris/Umbral, etc.)

## Mechanic-Based Interactions

These matrices catalog interactions based on specific game mechanics:

- [Blessing Interactions](interaction_matrices/blessing_interactions.md)
- [Corruption Interactions](interaction_matrices/corruption_interactions.md)
- [Delay Mechanics Interactions](interaction_matrices/delay_mechanics_interactions.md)
- [Evolution Interactions](interaction_matrices/evolution_interactions.md)
- [Mind Control Interactions](interaction_matrices/mind_control_interactions.md)
- [Destruction Interactions](interaction_matrices/destruction_interactions.md)
- [Technological Interactions](interaction_matrices/technological_interactions.md)

## Card Type Interactions

These matrices explore how different card types interact with each other:

- [Unit-Unit Interactions](interaction_matrices/unit_unit_interactions.md)
- [Unit-Action Interactions](interaction_matrices/unit_action_interactions.md)
- [Action-Action Combinations](interaction_matrices/action_action_combinations.md)
- [Condition-Unit Synergies](interaction_matrices/condition_unit_synergies.md)
- [Hero-Card Synergies](interaction_matrices/hero_card_synergies.md)
- [Crisis Card Interactions](interaction_matrices/crisis_card_interactions.md)

## Meta-Defining Combinations

These matrices highlight the most powerful and frequently used card combinations in the current meta:

- [Tier 1 Combinations](interaction_matrices/tier_1_combinations.md)
- [Combo Setup Cards](interaction_matrices/combo_setup_cards.md)
- [Combo Finisher Cards](interaction_matrices/combo_finisher_cards.md)
- [Combo Enabler Cards](interaction_matrices/combo_enabler_cards.md)
- [Anti-Meta Combinations](interaction_matrices/anti_meta_combinations.md)

## Interaction Notation System

Throughout these matrices, we use a standardized notation to describe card interactions:

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| + | Direct positive interaction |
| ++ | Strong synergy |
| +++ | Premium combo (greater than sum of parts) |
| ~ | Conditional interaction |
| ! | Requires specific sequencing |
| x | Negative interaction or anti-synergy |
| ‚Üí | Leads to or enables |
| ‚ü≥ | Creates loop or recursion |
| ¬ß | Rules exception or special case |

## How to Find Specific Interactions

To locate specific card interactions:

- Use the faction-specific matrices if you know the primary faction
- Use mechanic-based matrices if you're interested in a particular game mechanic
- Use the cross-faction matrices to find unexpected combinations
- Reference the meta-defining matrices for competitive-level combinations
- Use the notation system to identify the strongest synergies (marked with +++)

## Keeping Current with Meta Evolution

Card interactions evolve as new cards are released and player strategies develop. To stay current:

- Check the "Last Updated" date at the bottom of each matrix
- Reference the [Current Meta Analysis](../competitive/CURRENT_META_ANALYSIS.md) for emerging trends
- Note any cards marked with ‚ö†Ô∏è as they have received balance adjustments
- Cards marked with üÜï have been recently added to the interaction matrix

---

The interaction matrices are living documents that will be updated as the meta evolves and new cards are introduced. Players are encouraged to experiment with combinations not yet documented, as discovering new synergies is a key aspect of mastering the game.
