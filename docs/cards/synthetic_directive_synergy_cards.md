### Adaptive Assimilation Engine
**Cost**: 5 Energy
**Type**: Unit - Structure, Processing Node
**Stats**: 0/6
**Factions**: Synthetic Directive + Primordial Genesis
**Ability**: Whenever an enemy unit is destroyed, create a 1/1 Drone token with that unit's abilities.
**Flavor Text**: *"All biological traits can be analyzed, replicated, and optimized."*

## Infernal Core Synergies

### Overclocked Processor
**Cost**: 3 Energy
**Type**: Action
**Factions**: Synthetic Directive + Infernal Core
