## Rotation Philosophy

The Crisis Card rotation system serves several key design purposes:

- **Meta Evolution**: Prevents gameplay stagnation by regularly refreshing available strategic options
- **Power Management**: Controls the concentration of high-impact cards in the format
- **Design Space**: Creates room for new Crisis Cards without power creep
- **Collection Refresh**: Gives all players periodic "resets" in the power card meta
- **Balance Opportunity**: Provides natural points to address balance issues through rotation rather than nerfs
- **Narrative Integration**: Aligns with the evolving storyline of the game universe

## Format Structure

The game supports multiple formats with different Crisis Card pools:

| Format | Description | Crisis Card Pool | Primary Audience |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Standard | Primary competitive format | Core + 4 most recent seasons | Competitive players |
| Seasonal | Current season emphasis | Core + current season | General players |
| Eternal | All cards ever released | Complete Crisis Card pool | Veteran players |
| Curated | Hand-selected card pool | Designer-selected subset | Tournament players |
| Limited | Draft/sealed environment | Format-specific selection | Draft enthusiasts |

## Core Crisis Set

The foundation of all formats is the Core Crisis Set:

### Core Set Characteristics

- Contains approximately 20 Crisis Cards
- Represents fundamental game-altering effects
- Includes at least 2 Crisis Cards aligned with each faction
- Updated annually with select rotations and additions
- Designed to provide strategic options without dominating the meta

## Seasonal Rotation

Each 3-month season introduces new Crisis Cards and rotates old ones:

### Seasonal Release Structure

|------------------|-----------------|-------|---------------------|
| Seasonal Core | 5 Crisis Cards | Aligned with season theme | Rotates after 1 year (4 seasons) |
| Special Event | 3 Crisis Cards | Tied to mid-season event | Available during event, then earned through special challenges |

## Competitive Rotation

Competitive play uses a more controlled rotation to maintain balance:

### Tournament Format

The official tournament format includes:

- Core Crisis Set (complete)
- Current Season Crisis Set (complete)
- Previous Season Crisis Set (complete)
- Selected cards from earlier seasons (curated list)

### Banned and Restricted List

The competitive format maintains additional curation:

- **Banned Cards**: Crisis Cards temporarily removed from competitive play
- **Restricted Cards**: Limited to 1 per tournament lineup (across all decks)
- **Watched Cards**: Under performance monitoring but still legal
- **Provisional Cards**: New releases under special scrutiny

### Current Competitive Status

| Status | Crisis Cards | Reason | Review Date |
|--------|--------------|--------|-------------|
| Banned | "Infinite Recursion" | Enabling degenerate combo | Next season |
| Restricted | "Reality Anchor", "Void Collapse" | Format warping when combined | Mid-season |
| Watched | "Temporal Loop", "Cosmic Convergence" | High power level but currently balanced | Ongoing |
| Provisional | All cards from newest mini-release | Recent introduction | 3 weeks after release |

## Eternal Format

The Eternal format includes all Crisis Cards ever released:

### Format Management

Unlike Standard, Eternal management focuses on:

- Addressing problematic infinite combos or locks
- Managing degenerate strategies that prevent interaction
- Minimal intervention otherwise, embracing higher power level
- Special events and tournaments highlighting historic metas

### Eternal-Specific Mechanics

Some mechanics apply only to Eternal format:

- **Legacy Enhancements**: Buffs to older cards to make them viable
- **Crisis Fusion**: Combining elements of multiple rotated Crisis Cards
- **Vintage Challenges**: Achievements specific to using rotated cards
- **Historical Meta Events**: Time-limited events recreating past metas

## Crisis Card Lifecycle

Each Crisis Card follows this general lifecycle:

### Development Phase

- Initial design tied to mechanical and thematic goals
- Integration with existing card pool and mechanics
- Extensive testing for balance and interaction issues
- Art and flavor development aligned with season theme

### Active Standard Phase

- Initial release into Standard format
- Monitoring of impact on meta and play patterns
- Potential minor balance adjustments if needed
- Featured in seasonal competitions and events

### Late Standard Phase

- Established position in meta
- Development of counterplay and strategies
- Decreased feature in promotional material
- Preparation for potential rotation modifications

### Rotation Preparation

- Evaluation for Core set inclusion
- Assessment of format impact post-rotation
- Development of replacement cards/effects
- Pre-announcement of upcoming rotation

### Post-Rotation Phase

- Transition to Eternal format
- Legacy support through specific events
- Potential for seasonal return in curated events
- Archival in collection for non-Standard play

## Rebalancing Approach

The approach to balancing Crisis Cards changes through their lifecycle:

### Active Adjustment Period

During the first month after release:

- Weekly monitoring of play data
- Rapid adjustments to clearly problematic cards
- Focus on addressing unintended interactions
- Communication of change rationale to players

### Mature Period

From month 2 until pre-rotation:

- Monthly review of play patterns
- More conservative approach to changes
- Emphasis on meta adaptation over card changes
- Adjustments only for significant format issues

### Post-Rotation Period

After rotating from Standard:

- Minimal changes except for Eternal format health
- Focus on addressing infinite or non-interactive combos
- Legacy improvements to maintain Eternal viability
- Preservation of card identity and historical context

## Collection Impact

How rotation affects players' collections:

### Economic Considerations

- Crisis Cards never become completely unplayable
- Rotated cards retain value in Eternal format
- Special "Rotation Compensation" events provide resources
- Each rotation includes retrospective rewards for owned rotating cards
- Duplicate protection ensures rotating cards don't impact new pack openings

### Collection Display

The collection manager provides special features for rotated cards:

- Clear visual indicators of format legality
- Filtering options for Standard-legal Crisis Cards
- Special section for historic/rotated Crisis Cards
- Format-specific deck building options
- Usage suggestions for rotated cards in available formats

## Rotation Calendar

The annual rotation schedule provides predictability for players:

### Annual Cycle

| Month | Rotation Activity | Player Preparation Focus |
|-------|------------------|--------------------------|
| January | Major rotation (oldest season exits Standard) | Collection refinement |
| February | Post-rotation balance adjustment | Meta adaptation |
| April | Minor set release | Collection expansion |
| July | Mid-year rotation (second-oldest season exits) | Format transition |
| August | Post-rotation balance adjustment | Meta adaptation |
| October | Minor set release | Collection expansion |
| December | Pre-rotation announcement | Preparation for changes |

### Communication Timeline

For each rotation, information is released on this schedule:

- **3 Months Before**: Announcement of rotating sets
- **2 Months Before**: Preview of any Core set changes
- **1 Month Before**: Complete rotation details published
- **2 Weeks Before**: Special pre-rotation events begin
