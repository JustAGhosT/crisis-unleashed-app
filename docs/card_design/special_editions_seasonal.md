# Seasonal Special Edition Treatments

## Overview

Crisis Unleashed features rotating seasonal special editions that align with the game's in-universe calendar. Each season offers thematically appropriate visual treatments that transform existing cards with seasonal aesthetics. These editions provide recurring collectible opportunities tied to the game's seasonal events and storylines.

## Seasonal Design Philosophy

Seasonal editions follow these specific design principles:

1. **Thematic Immersion**: Each treatment deeply reflects the season's lore and atmosphere
2. **Consistent Framework**: All seasons use the same template structure with varying elements
3. **Collectible Cycles**: Cards form natural collecting sets within and across seasons
4. **Accessible Prestige**: More obtainable than championship editions but still visually distinctive
5. **Evergreen Value**: Treatments remain desirable even after the season concludes
