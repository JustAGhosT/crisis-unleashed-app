- **Die-Cut Precision**: +/- 0.2mm maximum variance from template
- **Surface Smoothness**: 5-8 Bekk seconds for optimal foil application

### Quality Control Process

Every print run undergoes this inspection process:

1. **Reference Comparison**: Against sealed master reference cards
2. **Light Booth Test**: Under standardized 5000K lighting conditions
3. **Angle Inspection**: Foil pattern checked at 15Â°, 45Â°, and 75Â° angles
4. **Microscope Check**: 10x magnification examination of pattern detail
5. **Durability Test**: Controlled shuffle and handling simulation
