# Faction Card Back Designs

## Overview

Card backs in Crisis Unleashed serve as both functional game elements and expressions of faction identity. Each faction has a signature card back design that visually represents its core themes, color palette, and philosophical approach to the crisis. This document provides comprehensive specifications for all faction card backs, including design principles, visual elements, and production requirements.

## Core Design Principles

All Crisis Unleashed card backs adhere to these fundamental principles:

1. **Faction Identity**: Each design clearly communicates the faction's theme and aesthetic
2. **Game Functionality**: Card backs must be non-distinguishable when face-down in a deck
3. **Visual Consistency**: All card backs share common structural elements while varying in details
4. **Production Viability**: Designs work across digital and physical formats including foil treatments
5. **Accessibility**: Patterns include colorblind-friendly elements for faction identification

## Standard Card Back Template

Every faction card back follows this structural template:

``` text
