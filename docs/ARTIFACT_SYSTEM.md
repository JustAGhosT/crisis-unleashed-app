# Artifact System

## Overview

Artifacts are powerful, persistent cards that provide ongoing benefits and strategic depth. They exist in a separate deck system, allowing players to build around specific artifact synergies without diluting their main deck.

## Core Rules

### 1. Artifact Deck Construction

- **Deck Size:** 5 cards
- **Copies:** Maximum 1 of each artifact
- **Faction Restrictions:** None, but faction bonuses apply
- **Starting Hand:** Each player draws 1 artifact at game start

### 2. Drawing Artifacts

- **Initial Draw:** 1 artifact at game start
- **Draw Cadence:** 1 artifact every 5 turns (turns 5, 10, 15, etc.)
- **Maximum Hand Size:** 3 artifacts (excess are discarded)
- **Mulligan:** Once per game, may shuffle 1 artifact into deck and draw 1

### 3. Playing Artifacts

- **Play Window:** Main phase, once per turn
- **Cost:** Varies by artifact (typically 3-6 Power)
- **Limit:** 1 active artifact at a time
- **Replacing:** May replace an existing artifact by paying its cost again

## Artifact Types

### 1. Relics (Passive Effects)

- Continuously active while in play
- Example: "Allied units have +1 DEF"

### 2. Artifacts (Activated Abilities)

- Can be activated during your turn
- May have cooldowns or costs
- Example: "2 Power: Deal 1 damage to a target"

### 3. Legendary Artifacts

- Powerful effects with higher costs
- Often have both passive and active components
- Limited to 1 per deck

```

```

### Neuralis Conclave

```markdown
**Neural Interface**  
*Artifact*  
**Cost:** 4 Power  
**Effect:**  

- Activated (1 Power): Look at the top 3 cards of your deck. Play 1 as if it cost 2 less  

*Neuralis Bonus:* Reduce the cost by 3 instead  
```

## Balance Considerations

### Power Level

- **Early Game:** Artifacts should be impactful but not game-ending
- **Late Game:** Legendary artifacts should feel powerful but not auto-win
- **Tempo:** High-cost artifacts should justify their investment

### Counterplay

- **Artifact Removal:** Some action cards can destroy artifacts
- **Silence Effects:** Can disable artifact abilities for a turn
- **Strategic Timing:** Playing around artifact activations

### Synergy

- **Faction Synergy:** Artifacts should enhance faction identity
- **Cross-Faction Combos:** Allow for creative deckbuilding
- **Anti-Synergy:** Some artifacts may counter specific strategies

## Playtesting Notes

### Test Cases

1. **Early Game Impact**
   - How does drawing an artifact on turn 1 affect tempo?
   - Are starting artifacts balanced across factions?

2. **Late Game Scaling**
   - Do artifacts remain relevant in late game?
   - Is there a power creep with multiple artifacts?

3. **Interaction Balance**
   - Are artifact removal options sufficient?
   - Do some artifacts feel "must-have" or "never-play"?

### Current Findings

- 5-turn draw cadence creates meaningful decisions
- Faction bonuses encourage thematic deckbuilding
- Legendary artifacts feel appropriately powerful

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Crisis Events

- Some crises may interact with artifacts
- Example: "Artifact abilities cost 1 less this turn"

### Hero Abilities

- Some heroes may interact with artifacts
- Example: "Your artifacts cost 1 less"

### Action Cards

- Some cards may interact with artifacts
- Example: "Destroy target artifact" or "Gain +1/+1 for each artifact you control"

## Example Artifact-Centric Deck

### Umbral Eclipse Artifact Control

**Hero:** Lady of the Veil  
**Strategy:** Use artifacts to control the board while building towards a stealth win condition

**Key Artifacts:**

1. Veilstone Pendant
2. Shadow Sigil (Grants Stealth to a unit each turn)
3. Dusk Shroud (Enemy spells cost 1 more)

**Synergies:**

- Artifacts maintain board control
- Stealth units capitalize on weakened enemies
- Disruption effects protect your strategy

## Future Considerations

### Expansion Ideas

- **Artifact Upgrades:** Ways to enhance existing artifacts
- **Artifact Destruction:** More ways to interact with opponent's artifacts
- **Artifact Tokens:** Temporary artifacts with one-time effects

### Tournament Rules

- Sideboard options for artifacts
- Banned/restricted lists
- Special formats (e.g., Artifact Draft)
