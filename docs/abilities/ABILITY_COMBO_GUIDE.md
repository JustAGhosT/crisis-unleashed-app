# Ability Combo Guide

This document serves as the main index for ability combination strategies, cataloging powerful synergies between unit and hero abilities across all factions.

## Overview

Ability combinations form the core of advanced gameplay, creating effects and advantages that exceed what individual abilities can accomplish. This guide provides:

- Strategic frameworks for identifying and executing ability combos
- Faction-specific combo patterns and signature interactions
- Cross-faction ability synergies for multi-faction decks
- Timing and sequencing guides for optimal execution
- Counter-strategies against common ability combinations

## How to Use This Guide

The ability combo documentation is structured as a reference system that can be approached from multiple angles:

- **By Faction**: If you're focused on a specific faction's playstyle
- **By Combo Type**: If you're looking for a specific strategic pattern
- **By Difficulty**: If you're learning or teaching the combo system
- **By Meta Relevance**: If you're preparing for competitive play

Each combo includes information on setup requirements, execution steps, expected outcomes, common counters, and variations.

## Combo Notation System

Throughout these guides, we use a standardized notation to describe ability interactions:

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ‚Üí | Sequence (perform abilities in this order) |
| + | Simultaneous or same-turn use |
| * | Repeatable step |
| ! | Critical timing requirement |
| ? | Conditional step based on board state |
| // | Alternative execution path |
| [x] | Ability with x cooldown turns |
| {r} | Requires r resources |
| (!) | Key strategic moment |

## Finding Specific Ability Combinations

To locate specific ability interactions:

- Use the faction-specific guides if you know the primary faction
- Use the combo categories for specific strategic goals
- Reference the difficulty guides when learning
- Use the competitive meta guides for tournament preparation

## Staying Current with Meta Evolution

Ability combinations evolve as new cards are released and player strategies develop. To stay current:

- Check the "Last Updated" date at the bottom of each guide
- Reference the [Current Meta Analysis](../competitive/CURRENT_META_ANALYSIS.md) for emerging trends
- Note any abilities marked with ‚ö†Ô∏è as they have received balance adjustments
- Abilities marked with üÜï have been recently added to the combo system

The ability combo guides are living documents that will be updated as the meta evolves and new abilities are introduced. Players are encouraged to experiment with combinations not yet documented, as discovering new synergies is a key aspect of mastering the game.
