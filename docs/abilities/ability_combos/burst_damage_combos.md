# Burst Damage Combo Guide

This document serves as the main index for burst damage ability combinations across all factions, providing a comprehensive overview of high-impact offensive strategies.

## Overview

Burst damage combinations allow players to deliver significant damage in a short timeframe, often within a single turn or activation sequence. These combos are essential for:

- Breaking through enemy defensive formations
- Eliminating high-priority targets
- Creating board state advantages
- Executing finishing sequences

This guide categorizes burst damage combos by faction, damage type, resource requirement, and execution complexity.

## Burst Damage Mechanics

Different burst damage strategies leverage various game mechanics:

- **Direct Damage**: Immediate damage to units or heroes
- **Area of Effect**: Damage across multiple targets
- **Conditional Damage**: Damage based on specific game states
- **Progressive Damage**: Escalating damage through combo sequences
- **Resource Conversion**: Transforming other resources into damage
- **Status-Based Damage**: Leveraging status effects for damage

## Combo Execution Principles

Fundamental guidelines for executing burst damage combinations:

### Setup Requirements

Most burst damage combos require some preparation:

- Positioning specific units
- Accumulating necessary resources
- Applying prerequisite status effects
- Preparing key cards in hand
- Managing ability cooldowns

### Timing Windows

Optimal execution timing for burst damage:

- After opponent depletes defensive resources
- When target is in vulnerable position
- During specific phases that enhance damage
- In response to specific opponent actions
- At key resource thresholds

### Protection Strategies

Protecting your combo pieces during setup:

- Misdirection tactics to hide true targets
- Defensive positioning of key combo units
- Resource reservation for protective abilities
- Timing execution to minimize disruption risk
- Alternative plans when primary combo is disrupted

### Follow-Up Actions

What to do after successful burst execution:

- Repositioning to protect vulnerable post-combo units
- Resource recovery techniques
- Secondary damage to finish surviving targets
- Defensive preparation for counter-attacks
- Board state consolidation

## Combo Notation System

Throughout the burst damage guides, we use standardized notation:

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| → | Sequence (perform abilities in this order) |
| + | Simultaneous or same-turn use |
| * | Repeatable step or multi-target application |
| ! | Critical timing requirement |
| ? | Conditional step based on damage output |
| // | Alternative execution path |
| [x] | Ability with x cooldown turns |
| {r} | Requires r resources |
| (d) | Deals d base damage |
