# Infernal Core Burst Damage Combos

This document serves as the main index for Infernal Core burst damage combinations, cataloging the faction's explosive and sacrifice-based offensive strategies.

## Faction Burst Identity

The Infernal Core specializes in high-risk, high-reward burst damage that often involves:

- **Sacrifice Mechanics**: Converting their own units or resources into damage
- **Overload Systems**: Pushing systems beyond limits for temporary power spikes
- **Chain Reactions**: Creating cascading damage effects
- **Self-Damage Management**: Balancing offensive power with self-preservation
- **Resource Conversion**: Transforming various resources into pure destruction

This faction excels at delivering massive single-turn damage spikes but often at significant cost to their own resources or board state.

## Burst Strategy Categories

Infernal Core burst strategies are divided into several distinct approaches:

- [Sacrifice-Based Burst](infernal/sacrifice_combos.md) - Converting friendly units into damage
- [Overload Engine Burst](infernal/overload_combos.md) - Pushing abilities beyond normal limits
- [Chain Reaction Burst](infernal/chain_reaction_combos.md) - Creating cascading damage effects
- [Resource Conversion Burst](infernal/resource_conversion_combos.md) - Transforming energy into damage
- [Self-Damage Burst](infernal/self_damage_combos.md) - Using self-harm to fuel greater offensive power

## Hero-Centered Burst Combos

Each Infernal Core hero offers unique burst damage potential:

- [Pyrus Combos](infernal/pyrus_combos.md) - The Inferno Sovereign's explosive potential
- [Cinder Combos](infernal/cinder_combos.md) - The Ash Harbinger's sacrifice sequences
- [Magmara Combos](infernal/magmara_combos.md) - The Molten Architect's structural destruction

## Key Burst Units

The most important Infernal Core units for burst damage strategies:

- [Sacrifice Engine Combos](infernal/sacrifice_engine_combos.md)
- [Flame Channeler Combos](infernal/flame_channeler_combos.md)
- [Molten Amplifier Combos](infernal/molten_amplifier_combos.md)
- [Explosive Catalyst Combos](infernal/explosive_catalyst_combos.md)
- [Destruction Architect Combos](infernal/destruction_architect_combos.md)

## Execution Complexity Levels

Infernal Core burst combos organized by execution difficulty:

- [Beginner Infernal Burst](infernal/beginner_combos.md) - Simple 2-3 ability sequences
- [Intermediate Infernal Burst](infernal/intermediate_combos.md) - Moderate complexity combinations
- [Advanced Infernal Burst](infernal/advanced_combos.md) - Complex multi-unit orchestration
- [Expert Infernal Burst](infernal/expert_combos.md) - Highest difficulty combinations

## Signature Burst Patterns

These patterns define the Infernal Core's unique approach to burst damage:

### The Sacrifice Cascade

**Core Pattern:** Sacrifice Initiator → Flame Amplifier → Chain Reactor → Final Catalyst

This signature pattern involves:

1. Sacrificing an initial unit to generate flame energy
2. Amplifying that energy through a specialized unit
3. Creating a chain reaction that grows with each step
4. Culminating in a final catalytic explosion

Full details in [Sacrifice Cascade Combos](infernal/sacrifice_cascade_combos.md)

### The Overload Sequence

**Core Pattern:** Energy Accumulator → Overload Initiator → Meltdown Controller → Eruption Finisher

This pattern involves:

1. Accumulating excess energy over several turns
2. Initiating an overload that exceeds normal limits
3. Controlling the meltdown to direct its force
4. Releasing the built-up energy in a massive eruption

Full details in [Overload Sequence Combos](infernal/overload_sequence_combos.md)

### The Phoenix Rebirth

**Core Pattern:** Self-Immolator → Ash Converter → Phoenix Engine → Rebirth Explosion

This pattern involves:

1. Destroying powerful friendly units for massive effect
2. Converting their remnants into energy
3. Triggering phoenix-like revival mechanics
4. Creating an explosion upon unit rebirth for double value
