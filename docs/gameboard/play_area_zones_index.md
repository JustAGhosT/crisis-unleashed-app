# Gameboard Layout: Play Area Zones

## Overview

The Crisis Unleashed gameboard is designed to provide a clear and intuitive layout for strategic gameplay. The board is divided into several distinct zones, each with its own purpose and rules. Understanding these zones is crucial for effective card placement, resource management, and combat strategy.

This document provides a high-level overview of the gameboard layout. For detailed information on each zone, please refer to the individual documents linked below.

## Core Gameboard Zones

The standard gameboard is divided into the following key zones:

1. **Hero Zone**: Where your chosen hero is placed and their abilities are tracked.
2. **Combat Zones**: The main area where units are played and engage in combat, divided into lanes.
3. **Condition Field**: Where ongoing condition cards are placed, affecting the entire board.
4. **Resource & Deck Zones**: Areas for managing your deck, discard pile, and other resources.

## Standard Gameboard Layout

A typical gameboard setup includes the following for each player:

- **One Hero Zone**
- **Three Combat Lanes** (Front, Middle, Back)
- **One Condition Field** (shared between players)
- **Deck, Discard, and Banish Piles**

This layout is designed to be adaptable for both physical and digital play, with clear divisions between zones to minimize confusion.

## Alternate Layouts

Crisis Unleashed also supports several alternate layouts for different play experiences:

- **Vertical Layout**: Designed for mobile devices, with zones stacked vertically.
- **Hex-Grid Layout**: A more complex layout for advanced players, allowing for diagonal movement and adjacency.
- **Tarot-Style Layout**: A narrative-focused layout used for specific campaign scenarios.

## Zone Interactions

Understanding how the different zones interact is key to mastering the game:

- **Hero Abilities** from the Hero Zone can affect units in the Combat Zones.
- **Condition Cards** in the Condition Field can modify the rules for all other zones.
- **Combat** is primarily resolved within the Combat Zones, but can be influenced by effects from any other zone.
