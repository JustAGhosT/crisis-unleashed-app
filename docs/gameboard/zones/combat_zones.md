# Combat Zones (Lanes)

## Overview

The Combat Zones, also known as lanes, are the primary area of the gameboard where units are deployed and where most combat takes place. The standard gameboard is divided into three lanes for each player, creating a dynamic and strategic battlefield.

## Structure of the Combat Zones

The Combat Zones are typically arranged in three parallel lanes, each with a front, middle, and back position. This creates a 3x3 grid for each player, providing a variety of placement options.

- **Front Lane**: The lane closest to the opponent. Units in the front lane are often the first to engage in combat.
- **Middle Lane**: The lane behind the front lane. Units in the middle lane can support the front lane or prepare for future combat.
- **Back Lane**: The lane furthest from the opponent. The back lane is often used for deploying units with ranged abilities or for protecting valuable assets.

## Unit Placement

When you play a unit card, you must choose an empty position in one of your Combat Zones to place it. The position you choose can have a significant impact on the game, as it determines which enemy units your unit can attack and which enemy units can attack it.

## Combat

Combat is resolved within the lanes. When a unit attacks, it can typically target an enemy unit in the same lane. The specific rules for targeting and combat resolution are detailed in the [Turn Order and Phases](./../rulebook/turn_order_and_phases.md) document.

## Lane-Based Effects

Many cards and abilities have effects that are specific to a particular lane. For example, an ability might deal damage to all enemy units in a single lane, or a condition card might provide a buff to all of your units in a specific lane. This makes lane positioning a key strategic consideration.

## Strategic Considerations

- **Lane Control**: Controlling the lanes is essential for controlling the game. By deploying units strategically, you can create favorable combat situations and put pressure on your opponent.
- **Unit Positioning**: The position of your units within the lanes is just as important as which lanes they are in. Placing a high-health unit in the front lane can protect more fragile units in the back lane, while placing a unit with a powerful ability in the middle lane can allow it to affect multiple lanes at once.
- **Lane-Based Combos**: Many powerful combos in Crisis Unleashed involve using lane-based effects to your advantage. For example, you might use an ability to move all enemy units into a single lane, and then use another ability to deal massive damage to that lane.
