# Condition Field

## Overview

The Condition Field is a shared area on the gameboard where ongoing condition cards are placed. These cards have persistent effects that can dramatically alter the rules of the game for both players.

## Structure of the Condition Field

The Condition Field is typically located in the center of the gameboard, between the two players' Combat Zones. It has a limited number of slots for condition cards, making control of this zone a key strategic element.

## Condition Cards

Condition cards are a special type of card that can be played into the Condition Field. Once played, their effects remain active until they are removed or replaced. These effects can be anything from changing the cost of cards to altering the stats of units.

## Controlling the Condition Field

Because the Condition Field is a shared zone with limited space, controlling it is a crucial part of the game. By playing your own condition cards, you can create a game state that is favorable to your strategy. Conversely, by removing your opponent's condition cards, you can disrupt their strategy and neutralize their advantages.

## Strategic Considerations

- **Building Around Conditions**: Many powerful decks are built around specific condition cards. By designing your deck to take advantage of the effects of your condition cards, you can create a powerful and synergistic strategy.
- **Countering Conditions**: Just as it is important to build around your own condition cards, it is also important to be able to counter your opponent's. Including cards in your deck that can remove or replace condition cards can be essential for dealing with certain matchups.
- **Timing is Everything**: The timing of when you play your condition cards can be critical. Playing a condition card too early can give your opponent time to prepare for it, while playing it too late may not give you enough time to take advantage of its effects.
