# Hero Zone

## Overview

The Hero Zone is the dedicated area on the gameboard where your chosen hero resides. This zone serves as the command center for your strategy, tracking your hero's health, momentum, and available abilities.

## Components of the Hero Zone

The Hero Zone is typically located at the bottom of your side of the board and contains the following components:

1. **Hero Card Slot**: Where your hero card is placed.
2. **Health Tracker**: A dial or counter to track your hero's current health.
3. **Momentum Tracker**: A counter to track your hero's momentum points.
4. **Ability Cooldown Slots**: Spaces to place cooldown counters for your hero's abilities.

## Hero Card

Your hero card is the centerpiece of the Hero Zone. It displays all the essential information about your hero, including:

- **Name and Faction**
- **Health, Attack, and other stats**
- **Signature, Basic, and Support abilities**
- **Heroic Path options**

## Health Tracking

Your hero's health is a critical resource. When your hero's health reaches zero, you lose the game. The health tracker in the Hero Zone should be clearly visible to both players at all times.

## Momentum

Momentum is a special resource that only your hero can generate and use. It is tracked in the Hero Zone and is used to activate your hero's powerful signature abilities.

- **Gaining Momentum**: Your hero typically gains 1 Momentum at the start of your turn.
- **Spending Momentum**: Momentum is spent to activate your hero's signature ability, as specified on the hero card.
- **Momentum Cap**: Momentum is typically capped at 5. Any excess Momentum gained is lost.

## Ability Cooldowns

Many hero abilities have cooldowns, which are tracked in the Hero Zone. When a hero ability with a cooldown is used, a counter is placed in the appropriate cooldown slot. This counter is reduced by one at the start of each of your turns. When the counter reaches zero, the ability can be used again.

## Strategic Considerations

- **Protecting Your Hero**: While your hero is in the Hero Zone, they can still be targeted by enemy abilities and attacks. It is crucial to protect your hero from taking too much damage.
- **Managing Momentum**: Deciding when to spend your Momentum is a key strategic choice. Do you use your signature ability as soon as you have enough Momentum, or do you save it for a more opportune moment?
- **Timing Cooldowns**: Effectively managing your ability cooldowns is essential for maximizing your hero's impact on the game. Using an ability at the right time can be the difference between victory and defeat.
