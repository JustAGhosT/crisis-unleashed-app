# Resource & Deck Zones

## Overview

The Resource & Deck Zones are the areas on the gameboard where you manage your deck, discard pile, and other resources. These zones are typically located to the side of your main play area.

## Components of the Resource & Deck Zones

The Resource & Deck Zones consist of the following components:

1. **Deck**: Where your deck of cards is placed.
2. **Discard Pile**: Where your used and discarded cards are placed.
3. **Banish Pile**: Where cards that have been removed from the game are placed.
4. **Energy Crystals**: A pool of crystals or tokens to track your current energy.

## Deck

Your deck is the primary source of your cards throughout the game. It is placed face-down in the Deck zone, and you draw cards from it at the start of each of your turns.

## Discard Pile

When you play a card or when one of your units is destroyed, it is placed in the Discard Pile. The Discard Pile is face-up, so both you and your opponent can see its contents. This allows for strategic play around cards that interact with the Discard Pile.

## Banish Pile

Some cards and abilities can banish cards, removing them from the game entirely. Banished cards are placed in the Banish Pile and cannot be returned to the game by any means.

## Energy Crystals

Energy is the primary resource you use to play cards and activate abilities. Your available energy is tracked using Energy Crystals or tokens. You gain a certain amount of energy at the start of each of your turns, as detailed in the [Turn Order and Phases](../../rulebook/turn_order_and_phases.md) document.

## Strategic Considerations

- **Deck Management**: Knowing the contents of your deck and managing your draws is a key skill in Crisis Unleashed. Cards that allow you to search your deck or manipulate your draws can be very powerful.
- **Discard Pile Interactions**: Many cards have effects that interact with the Discard Pile. These can range from returning cards from your Discard Pile to your hand, to having effects that trigger when they are in the Discard Pile.
- **Resource Management**: Effectively managing your energy is crucial for success. You need to balance playing powerful cards with ensuring you have enough energy to respond to your opponent's threats.
