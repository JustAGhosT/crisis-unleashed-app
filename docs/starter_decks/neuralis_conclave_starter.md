# Neuralis Conclave Starter Deck: "Mind Over Matter"

## Deck Overview

The Neuralis Conclave "Mind Over Matter" starter deck embodies the faction's mastery of mental manipulation, psychic connections, and strategic foresight. This deck excels at controlling the opponent's options, creating psychic networks between units, and predicting game flow for strategic advantage. The strategy revolves around establishing mind links between units, manipulating the opponent's hand and board, and leveraging predictive advantages.

**Core Playstyle**: Psychic control with mindlink mechanics  
**Difficulty**: ★★★★☆ (Advanced)  
**Key Mechanics**: Mindlink, Psychic Field, Telepathy, Influence

## Hero Card

### Apex (Neuralis Conclave)

**Health**: 24  
**Special Ability**: Neural Override - Once per turn, look at your opponent's hand and choose a card. That card costs 2 more to play until your next turn.  
**Passive**: At the start of your turn, look at the top card of your opponent's deck. You may place it on the bottom.  
**Ultimate (4 Momentum)**: Mind Domination - Gain control of an enemy unit with cost 3 or less until end of turn. It gains Rush.

**Hero Strategy**: Apex excels at disrupting the opponent's plans through information advantage. Use Neural Override regularly to delay their key cards, particularly targeting their curve plays. The passive ability provides constant deck manipulation to deny draws. Save the Ultimate for either gaining control of a key enemy unit for attack purposes or to remove a troublesome blocker.

## Key Cards

### Mindlink Adept (Unit)

This key 2-cost unit enables your Mindlink strategy by connecting to another unit upon entry. The flexibility to choose which unit to connect to makes it adaptable to different situations. While modest in stats, its ability to enable your core mechanic makes it an essential engine piece.

### Thought Projector (Unit)

A crucial support unit that enhances all your Mindlinked units. Its 3 health makes it relatively resilient, and when protected, it can significantly increase the power of your connected network of units. Position this carefully to maximize its benefit while keeping it safe.

### Psychic Field (Condition)

A powerful lane enhancer that boosts your units while establishing the foundation for your psychic territory control. Strategic placement in lanes where you plan to develop your board creates zones of advantage that are difficult for opponents to contest.

### Neural Network (Condition)

The ultimate enabler of your Mindlink synergies, transforming individual Mindlink connections into a complete psychic web. This single card dramatically amplifies the power of all your Mindlink-based effects by ensuring all your units benefit.

### Apex Mentalist (Unit)

Your top-end finisher that immediately establishes multiple Psychic Fields, creating a powerful board-wide advantage. This unit turns separate lanes into a unified psychic battlefield where all your units gain benefits.

## Key Synergies

### Information Control Loop

Telepathic Initiate → Mental Disruption → Neural Override
This combination provides complete information about your opponent's hand and forces revelation of new draws, while making key cards prohibitively expensive to play. This creates significant disruption and strategic advantage.

### Mindlink Network

Mindlink Adept → Thought Projector → Neural Network
Build a network of connected units enhanced by Thought Projector, then dramatically amplify the effect with Neural Network to create an interwoven board of empowered units. This creates both offensive and defensive advantages.

### Psychic Terrain Control

Psychic Field → Apex Mentalist → Unit Development
Establish dominant lane control through Psychic Fields, extend that control to all lanes with Apex Mentalist, then develop units within those fields for maximum advantage. This territorial approach limits opponent options.

### Information-Based Removal

Mind Probe → Cerebral Shock → Mental Dominator
Gain information about the opponent's hand to enable enhanced removal with Cerebral Shock, then use Mental Dominator to neutralize blocking potential. This creates both board control and attack opportunities.

## Game Plan

### Early Game (Turns 1-3)

- Establish information advantage with Telepathic Initiate and Neural Scout
- Begin developing your Mindlink network with Mindlink Adept
- Use Mind Probe to maintain hand information and draw cards
- Consider playing Psychic Field in a key lane or Mental Disruption for ongoing disruption

### Mid Game (Turns 4-6)

- Establish multiple Mindlinked pairs enhanced by Thought Projector
- Use Psychic Link to expand your Mindlink network and maintain card advantage
- Deploy Psychic Operative to maintain complete information advantage
- Remove key threats with enhanced Cerebral Shock

### Late Game (Turns 7+)

- Deploy Apex Mentalist to establish board-wide Psychic Fields
- Consider Neural Network to maximize Mindlink synergies
- Use Apex's Ultimate to gain control of key enemy units at critical moments
- Look for lethal damage through unblockable attacks with Mental Dominator
