# Primordial Genesis Starter Decks

*Note: Full development of these decks has been postponed, but this template outlines the planned structure.*

## Overview

The Primordial Genesis faction specializes in evolution, adaptation, and overwhelming force. Their creatures grow stronger over time, adapt to battlefield conditions, and harness the raw power of nature to overwhelm opponents.

## Planned Starter Decks

### Evolutionary Ascension

**Theme**: Growth and adaptation over time

- **Key Mechanic**: Units evolve after specific conditions are met
- **Strategy**: Start with weaker units that become powerful over time
- **Core Cards**: Alpha Specimen, Adaptation Catalyst, Genetic Recombinator

### Primal Swarm

**Theme**: Overwhelming with numbers

- **Key Mechanic**: Rapid reproduction and token generation
- **Strategy**: Create numerous small creatures to overwhelm defenses
- **Core Cards**: Swarm Queen, Breeding Pools, Multiplicity Spores

### Apex Predator

**Theme**: Survival of the fittest

- **Key Mechanic**: Consuming allies to power up key units
- **Strategy**: Sacrifice weaker units to create unstoppable predators
- **Core Cards**: Apex Hunter, Consumption Ritual, Predatory Instinct

## Faction Strengths

- Excellent scaling into late game
- Highly adaptable to changing conditions
- Strong recovery from board wipes through rapid reproduction

## Faction Weaknesses

- Slow early game development
- Vulnerable to targeted removal of key evolving units
- Reliance on evolutionary synergies

## Synergies with Other Factions

- **Aeonic Dominion**: Accelerated evolution through time manipulation
- **Infernal Core**: Sacrifice synergies for explosive growth
- **Neuralis Conclave**: Guided evolution through mental control
