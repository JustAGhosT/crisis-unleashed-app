# PvP Balance Guidelines

## Overview

These Player versus Player (PvP) Balance Guidelines ensure fair and enjoyable matches between the various Crisis Unleashed starter decks and provide a framework for balanced deck construction beyond the starter experience. The guidelines help maintain competitive integrity while preserving the unique identity of each faction.

## Core Balance Principles

Crisis Unleashed balancing follows these fundamental principles:

1. **Faction Identity Preservation**: Each faction maintains its unique mechanical identity and playstyle
2. **Power Level Parity**: All factions have comparable power levels through different strategic approaches
3. **Counter-Strategy Availability**: Every strategy has viable counterplay options
4. **Learning Curve Balance**: More complex strategies offer proportionately greater rewards for mastery
5. **Tempo Equilibrium**: Aggressive, midrange, and control approaches are all viable

## Starter Deck Matchup Matrix

The starter decks are designed with the following approximate win rates against each other:

| Deck | vs. Solaris | vs. Umbral | vs. Aeonic | vs. Primordial | vs. Infernal | vs. Neuralis | vs. Synthetic |
|------|-------------|------------|------------|----------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| Solaris "Radiant Dawn" | - | 45-55% | 55-45% | 50-50% | 40-60% | 45-55% | 55-45% |
| Umbral "Shadow's Embrace" | 55-45% | - | 45-55% | 50-50% | 55-45% | 40-60% | 50-50% |
| Aeonic "Timeless Authority" | 45-55% | 55-45% | - | 60-40% | 45-55% | 50-50% | 40-60% |
| Primordial "Evolutionary Surge" | 50-50% | 50-50% | 40-60% | - | 55-45% | 45-55% | 55-45% |
| Infernal "Burning Vengeance" | 60-40% | 45-55% | 55-45% | 45-55% | - | 50-50% | 40-60% |
| Neuralis "Mind Over Matter" | 55-45% | 60-40% | 50-50% | 55-45% | 50-50% | - | 45-55% |
| Synthetic "Calculated Assembly" | 45-55% | 50-50% | 60-40% | 45-55% | 60-40% | 55-45% | - |

*Note: These percentages represent expected win rates in matches between equally skilled players.*

## Strategic Archetype Balance

### Aggressive Strategies

- **Expected Turn to Win**: 5-7
- **Resource Conversion Rate**: 1 Energy = ~1.5 damage
- **Board Presence**: Wide rather than tall
- **Counterplay**: Board clears, healing, Defender units

### Midrange Strategies

- **Expected Turn to Win**: 7-9
- **Resource Conversion Rate**: 1 Energy = ~1.2 damage + 0.3 board presence
- **Board Presence**: Balance of quality and quantity
- **Counterplay**: Tempo disruption, superior value generation

### Control Strategies

- **Expected Turn to Win**: 9+
- **Resource Conversion Rate**: 1 Energy = ~0.8 damage + 0.7 value/disruption
- **Board Presence**: Quality over quantity
- **Counterplay**: Pressure, resource depletion, alt win conditions

## Resource Economy Standards

### Energy Efficiency Guidelines

| Card Cost | Expected Impact | Example Effect |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| 1 Energy | Single small effect | 2 damage OR 1/2 unit OR draw 1 card |
| 2 Energy | Single medium effect | 3 damage OR 2/2 unit OR targeted removal |
| 3 Energy | Single large effect OR two small effects | 4 damage OR 3/3 unit OR small board effect |
| 4 Energy | Multiple medium effects | 4/4 unit OR board-wide small effect |
| 5+ Energy | Game-changing effects | 5/5+ unit OR massive board impact |

### Card Advantage Guidelines

- Direct card draw: ~2 Energy per card
- Conditional card draw: ~1 Energy per card
- Card creation: ~1.5 Energy per card
- Card selection: ~0.5 Energy per selection

### Tempo Guidelines

- Removing 1 Energy worth of opponent's development: worth ~0.7 Energy
- Acceleration effects (cost reduction): Maximum 2 Energy discount per card
- Delay effects: ~0.5 Energy per turn of delay

## Faction-Specific Balance Considerations

## Balance Testing Methodology

All Crisis Unleashed decks undergo rigorous balance testing:

1. **AI Simulation**: 10,000+ simulated games between decks with perfect play
2. **Blind Playtesting**: Testing with players unaware of expected outcomes
3. **Pro Player Analysis**: Expert review by top competitive players
4. **New Player Experience**: Testing with players new to card games
5. **Statistical Analysis**: Win rate, turn count, and resource efficiency tracking

## Balance Warning Signs

These metrics may indicate balance issues requiring attention:

1. **Win Rate Extremes**: Any matchup exceeding 65-35% win rate
2. **Turn Speed Outliers**: Games consistently ending before turn 5 or after turn 12
3. **Resource Conversion Imbalance**: Strategies converting resources at >1.5x standard rate
4. **Must-Include Cards**: Any card appearing in >80% of decks for its faction
5. **Uninteractive Mechanics**: Strategies with no viable counterplay

## Player-Run Tournament Guidelines

For player-organized tournaments using starter decks:

1. **Deck Verification**: Players must use unmodified starter decks
2. **Format Options**:
   - Single Faction: All players use the same starter deck
   - Open Faction: Players choose any starter deck
   - Conquest: Players bring multiple starter decks
3. **Match Structure**: Best of 3 games recommended
4. **Sideboarding**: Not permitted with unmodified starter decks
5. **Time Limits**: 30 minutes per match recommended

## Community Balance Council

The Crisis Unleashed Community Balance Council provides ongoing monitoring:

1. **Composition**: Developers, pro players, and community representatives
2. **Data Collection**: Regular analysis of play data across all platforms
3. **Update Schedule**: Balance assessments monthly, adjustments quarterly
4. **Feedback Loop**: Public testing of potential changes before implementation
5. **Transparency**: Published reasoning behind all balance decisions

## Constructed Format Balance

As players move beyond starter decks to constructed formats:

1. **Deck Building Restrictions**: 1 Hero + 30 main deck cards, maximum 3 copies per card
2. **Resource Curve**: Recommended 6-8 cards each at 1, 2, and 3 Energy
3. **Unit/Non-Unit Ratio**: Recommended 16-20 units in most decks
4. **Cross-Faction Limitations**: Additional Energy cost for off-faction cards
5. **Synergy Premium**: Cards designed to work together valued up to 20% higher

## Digital-Specific Balance Considerations

The digital version has additional balance mechanisms:

1. **Dynamic Difficulty**: AI opponents adjust to player skill level
2. **Matchmaking Rating**: Players matched based on skill and deck strength
3. **Deck Strength Algorithm**: System estimates relative power level of custom decks
4. **Balance Hotfixes**: Critical issues can be addressed between major updates
5. **A/B Testing**: Limited testing of balance changes with player segments

## Physical-Specific Balance Considerations

The physical version has its own balance mechanisms:

1. **Set Rotation**: Regular introduction of new cards and retirement of old ones
2. **Preconstructed Power Levels**: All preconstructed products of similar power
3. **Rarity Distribution**: Power distributed across rarity tiers, not concentrated
4. **Errata Process**: Regular publication of updated card text when necessary
5. **Format Separation**: Different formats (Standard, Legacy, etc.) with separate banned lists
