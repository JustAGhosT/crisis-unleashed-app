# Aeonic Dominion Starter Deck: "Timeless Authority"

## Deck Overview

The Aeonic Dominion "Timeless Authority" starter deck embodies the faction's mastery over time and strategic foresight. This deck excels at controlling the flow of battle through delay mechanics, temporal manipulation, and precise timing. The strategy revolves around setting up powerful delayed effects, manipulating cooldowns, and creating advantageous temporal loops for consistent value.

**Core Playstyle**: Tempo control with delay mechanics  
**Difficulty**: ★★★★☆ (Advanced)  
**Key Mechanics**: Delay, Time Shift, Paradox, Regression

## Hero Card

### Chronus (Aeonic Dominion)

**Health**: 25  
**Special Ability**: Temporal Adjustment - Once per turn, increase or decrease a Delay counter on any card by 1.  
**Passive**: At the start of your turn, all your Delay effects count down twice.  
**Ultimate (5 Momentum)**: Temporal Loop - Return target unit to its owner's hand. If it was yours, it costs 2 less Energy to replay. If it was an enemy's, it costs 2 more.

**Hero Strategy**: Chronus excels at manipulating your Delay effects and disrupting enemy timing. Use Temporal Adjustment to speed up your own beneficial Delay effects or extend harmful enemy effects. The passive ability makes your Delay effects significantly faster, which should inform your timing decisions. Save the Ultimate for either returning your own high-value units for replay (with their "when played" effects) or for disrupting enemy tempo by forcing them to replay costly units.

## Key Cards

### Timekeeper (Unit)

This unassuming 2-cost unit dramatically accelerates your Delay strategy by making all your Delay effects count down faster. With multiple Timekeepers, you can resolve Delay effects almost immediately. Protect these units as they form the core engine of your deck.

### Temporal Distortion (Condition)

A powerful disruption tool that forces all enemy units to enter play with a Delay counter, effectively giving you a tempo advantage every time they deploy a unit. This card dramatically slows down aggressive strategies and synergizes with your other Delay-interaction cards.

### Chrono Engineer (Unit)

Provides manual control over Delay counters, allowing you to accelerate key effects when needed. The flexibility to choose which counter to reduce gives you tactical options that complement Chronus's hero ability.

### Time Reversal (Action)

A powerful reset button that can undo an entire turn's worth of unit deployments. Use it defensively when your opponent commits multiple units to the board, or offensively to replay your own units with valuable "when played" effects.

### Paradox Field (Condition)

Transforms your Delay effects into an Energy advantage engine. As your various Delay effects resolve throughout the game, this condition provides the Energy to deploy more units and spells, creating a snowballing advantage.

## Key Synergies

### Delay Acceleration

Timekeeper → Chrono Engineer → Multiple Delay Effects
This combination allows your Delay effects to count down extremely quickly, sometimes resolving the turn after they're played. Use this to create unexpected bursts of effects that your opponent can't anticipate.

### Tempo Disruption

Temporal Distortion → Time Warden → Time Skip
Create maximum disruption by ensuring enemy units always enter with Delay, further extending those delays, and then completely preventing priority units from acting. This locks down the opponent's development.

### Value Loop

Time Traveler → Units with "When Played" Effects → Chronus's Ultimate
Create a loop of value by repeatedly returning and replaying units with beneficial entry effects. Particularly powerful with Chrono Scout, Temporal Initiate, and Paradox Mage.

### Paradox Combination

Paradox Mage → Paradox Field → Time Dilation
The self-copying Paradox Mage creates delayed copies of itself, which trigger Paradox Field for Energy generation, and then potentially resolve twice with Time Dilation, creating an exponential value engine.

## Game Plan

### Early Game (Turns 1-3)

- Deploy value-generating units like Temporal Initiate and Chrono Scout
- Establish your Delay engine with Timekeeper
- Consider playing Temporal Distortion to slow opponent development
- Use Time Skip to neutralize early threats

### Mid Game (Turns 4-6)

- Deploy Temporal Knight and Chrono Engineer to capitalize on Delay effects
- Start manipulating Delay counters with Chronus's ability
- Look for opportunities to reset the board with Time Reversal
- Establish ongoing value with Paradox Field

### Late Game (Turns 7+)

- Deploy Time Traveler to create value loops with key units
- Use Chronus's Ultimate to either generate value or severely disrupt opponent
- Maintain tempo advantage through consistent Delay manipulation
- Look for lethal damage opportunities when opponent has fallen behind on tempo

## Matchup Advice

### Against Solaris Nexus "Radiant Dawn"

- Focus on delaying their key blessing units like Dawn Priest
- Use Time Skip to neutralize their Defender units during critical attack turns
- Save Time Reversal for when they've committed multiple units
- Control the game pace - you win the long game against their more straightforward strategy

### Against Umbral Eclipse "Shadow's Embrace"

- Deploy Temporal Distortion to slow their evasive units
- Use Chrono Blast to deal with their lower-health units
- Track their corrupted units to predict their strategic targets
- Maintain board presence to prevent their direct hero damage strategy

### Against Infernal Core "Burning Vengeance"

- Carefully time Delay effects to avoid their sacrifice triggers
- Use Time Reversal to undo their burst turns
- Maintain life total with defensive units while establishing your engine
- Control the pace - their strategy becomes predictable when slowed down

## Upgrade Path

As your collection grows, consider these improvements to the Timeless Authority deck:

### Priority Additions

1. **Temporal Adept** (Rare Unit): 3-cost 3/3 with "When your Delay effects resolve, you may apply them again with their original countdown."
2. **Timeline Split** (Rare Action): 3-cost "Copy target Delay effect on a card you control. You choose the target of the copy."
3. **Inevitable Fate** (Epic Condition): 5-cost "Ongoing: At the start of the game, predict a turn number from 5-10. When that turn begins, you win the game if you have 15 or more Health."

### Potential Replacements

1. Replace 1x Temporal Knight with 1x Temporal Adept
2. Replace 1x Probability Shift with 1x Timeline Split
3. Replace 1x Regression Loop with 1x Inevitable Fate

### Advanced Strategy Upgrades

As you become more familiar with the faction, consider building toward these more advanced archetypes:

- **Tempo Time**: Focus on maximum opponent disruption with delayed removal effects
- **Paradox Combo**: Build around self-copying effects and Delay acceleration for explosive turns
- **Fate Control**: Center the strategy around alternate win conditions like Inevitable Fate

## Playing Tips for New Players

1. **Count Your Triggers**: Keep track of how many Delay effects will resolve each turn
2. **Plan Ahead**: Think about the board state several turns ahead
3. **Resource Management**: Balance immediate needs vs. future Delay payoffs
4. **Tracking Importance**: Monitor both your and your opponent's Delay effects
5. **Activation Order**: Consider the sequence of Delay resolutions for maximum effect
