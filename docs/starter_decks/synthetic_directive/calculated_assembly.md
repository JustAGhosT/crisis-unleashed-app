# Synthetic Directive Starter Deck: "Calculated Assembly"

## Deck Overview

The Synthetic Directive "Calculated Assembly" starter deck embodies the faction's focus on modular construction, technological efficiency, and systematic development. This deck excels at assembling components into powerful constructs, upgrading units throughout the game, and creating precise combinations of interlocking parts. The strategy revolves around methodical board development, component synergies, and continual improvement of your technological forces.

**Core Playstyle**: Modular midrange with assembly mechanics  
**Difficulty**: ★★☆☆☆ (Beginner-friendly)  
**Key Mechanics**: Assemble, Upgrade, Recycle, Network

## Hero Card

### Protocol (Synthetic Directive)

**Health**: 25  
**Special Ability**: Rapid Assembly - Once per turn, reduce the cost of the next component unit you play by 1.  
**Passive**: When you play a component unit, give another unit you control +0/+1.  
**Ultimate (3 Momentum)**: System Upgrade - Give all units you control +1/+1. Upgrade all upgrade modules on your units.

**Hero Strategy**: Protocol supports methodical, component-based construction. Use Rapid Assembly regularly to accelerate your board development by reducing component costs. The passive ability gradually reinforces your units as you develop the board. Save the Ultimate for when you have multiple units with upgrade modules to maximize value through both the stat boost and module enhancement.

| 1 | Optimization Algorithm | 3 | Ongoing: When you attach a module to a unit, that unit gains +1/+1 in addition to the module's effect. |

## Key Cards

### Modular Enforcer (Unit)

A crucial 2-cost engine piece that provides card advantage every time you attach a module to it. This creates a powerful incentive to direct your modules to this unit, especially early in the game. Its 2/2 statline is reasonable for the cost even without its ability, making it an efficient early play.

### Network Node (Unit)

This key infrastructure piece expands the impact of your modules by allowing networked units to share them. Proper positioning of units around the Network Node is critical to maximizing its value. This card transforms individual modular units into an interconnected system.

### Assembly Line (Condition)

A powerful economic engine that reduces the cost of components as long as you keep playing them. This creates a snowball effect where playing components makes future components cheaper, enabling explosive turns in the mid to late game.

### Combat Chassis (Unit)

The ultimate module carrier, capable of holding three times the normal module limit. This versatile unit can become a massive threat when fully equipped, or can be built as a powerful defensive wall depending on which modules you attach.

### Assembly Mainframe (Unit)

Your top-end finisher that provides immediate impact by allowing free attachment of modules from hand. This creates a significant tempo advantage and can transform your board state in a single turn.

## Key Synergies

### Module Chain

Assembly Drone → Modular Enforcer → Weapon/Defense Module
Start with a cheap modular unit, deploy the card-drawing Enforcer, then attach modules to generate card advantage while building a powerful unit.

### Network Efficiency

Network Node → Multiple Component Units → Network Protocol
Establish a network with strategically placed Network Nodes, position units to benefit from shared modules, then expand to a global network with Network Protocol for maximum efficiency.

### Upgrade Path

Module Attachments → Upgrade Specialist → Protocol's Ultimate
Combine various module attachments with the Upgrade Specialist to enhance them, then use Protocol's Ultimate to upgrade all modules at once for a massive board-wide improvement.

### Component Economy

Assembly Line → Rapid Fabrication → Mass Production
Create a powerful economic engine that reduces component costs, draws into more components with discounts, and then uses Mass Production to fetch specific components needed for your strategy.

## Game Plan

### Early Game (Turns 1-3)

- Deploy early component units like Assembly Drone and Scanner Bot
- Use Scanner Bot to set up your draws for key components
- Establish Modular Enforcer to begin generating card advantage
- Consider playing Assembly Line to start reducing component costs

### Mid Game (Turns 4-6)

- Deploy Network Node and position units strategically around it
- Begin attaching modules to key units (prioritize Modular Enforcer for card draw)
- Use Precision Strike to remove threatening enemy units
- Consider Recycle Parts to repurpose modules if the board state changes

### Late Game (Turns 7+)

- Deploy Combat Chassis and load it with multiple modules
- Use Assembly Mainframe for a massive tempo play with free module attachments
- Activate Protocol's Ultimate when you have multiple units with modules
- Look for lethal damage through an optimized board of enhanced units

## Matchup Advice

### Against Solaris Nexus "Radiant Dawn"

- Focus on attaching Defense Modules to counter their blessing-enhanced units
- Use Network Node to share defensive benefits across multiple units
- Save Precision Strike for their key blessing enablers like Dawn Priest
- Build a single heavily-modded Combat Chassis to counter their Defender strategy

### Against Umbral Eclipse "Shadow's Embrace"

- Spread modules across multiple units to mitigate their targeted corruption
- Use Precision Strike to remove their evasive threats
- Establish Assembly Line early to outpace their slower corruption strategy
- Use networked units to maintain board presence against their removal

### Against Aeonic Dominion "Timeless Authority"

- Focus on steady development rather than all-in strategies vulnerable to their time manipulation
- Use Rapid Fabrication to accelerate through their delay effects
- Save Recycle Parts to repurpose units targeted by their time effects
- Establish Network Protocol to maximize the impact of each successful deployment

### Against Primordial Genesis "Evolutionary Surge"

- Target their evolution enablers with Precision Strike
- Build wide with multiple modular units to contest their developing threats
- Use Defense Modules to create favorable trades against their evolving units
- Establish Assembly Mainframe before they reach their late-game evolved forms

## Upgrade Path

As your collection grows, consider these improvements to the Calculated Assembly deck:

### Priority Additions

1. **Perfected Module** (Rare Unit): 3-cost 2/2 with "Component. When played, attach a +1/+1 module to any unit, then upgrade all modules on that unit."
2. **Mass Assembly** (Rare Action): 3-cost "Reduce the cost of all Component cards in your hand by 1. Draw a card for each Component you control."
3. **Synthetic Evolution** (Epic Condition): 5-cost "Ongoing: At the start of your turn, upgrade all modules attached to your units. Units with 3 or more modules gain all keywords."

### Potential Replacements

1. Replace 1x Weapon Module with 1x Perfected Module
2. Replace 1x Recycle Parts with 1x Mass Assembly
3. Replace 1x Optimization Algorithm with 1x Synthetic Evolution

### Advanced Strategy Upgrades

As you become more familiar with the faction, consider building toward these more advanced archetypes:

- **Network Dominance**: Focus on maximum module sharing through extensive networking
- **Modular Colossus**: Build a single, massively enhanced unit with multiple upgraded modules
- **Assembly Economy**: Create an efficient component production engine for overwhelming board presence

## Playing Tips for New Players

1. **Module Planning**: Think about which units will receive modules before playing components
2. **Positioning Importance**: Place units adjacent to Network Nodes for maximum benefit
3. **Component Tracking**: Keep track of components in deck for Rapid Fabrication value
4. **Resource Curve**: Use Assembly Line and Protocol's ability to smooth out your Energy curve
5. **Module Math**: Calculate potential damage from Precision Strike before committing resources
