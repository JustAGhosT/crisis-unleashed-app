# Synthetic Directive Starter Deck: "Protocol Override"

## Deck Overview

The Synthetic Directive "Protocol Override" starter deck showcases the faction's focus on system manipulation, program control, and technological infiltration. This deck excels at overriding enemy systems, manipulating resources, and deploying sophisticated technological solutions to every problem. The strategy revolves around controlling the board through program manipulation, energy efficiency, and precise algorithmic responses.

**Core Playstyle**: Control-combo with system manipulation  
**Difficulty**: ★★★☆☆ (Intermediate)  
**Key Mechanics**: Override, Hack, Energy Manipulation, System Control

## Hero Card

### Cypher (Synthetic Directive)

**Health**: 24  
**Special Ability**: System Override - Once per turn, take control of an enemy unit with 2 or less Attack until end of turn.  
**Mode Switch**: Once per turn, transform between Infiltration Mode and Disruption Mode.  
**Infiltration Mode**: Your Override effects cost 1 less Energy.  
**Disruption Mode**: Enemy units that you Override get -1/-0.  
**Ultimate (4 Momentum)**: Master Program - Take control of all enemy units with 3 or less Attack until your next turn.

**Hero Strategy**: Cypher excels at manipulating the opponent's resources and turning them against their owner. Begin in Infiltration Mode to establish control efficiently, then switch to Disruption Mode to weaken key threats. Use System Override regularly to neutralize enemy threats or gain temporary advantage. Save the Ultimate for when the opponent has multiple valuable units with 3 or less Attack.

## Key Cards

### Protocol Disruptor (Unit)

This 2-cost unit provides immediate Override effects upon entry, allowing you to immediately gain control of small enemy units. Although the Override is temporary, it enables critical tempo swings early in the game while establishing your board presence.

### System Analyst (Unit)

A key engine piece that generates card advantage from your Override effects. Paired with your hero's ability and other Override sources, this can draw multiple additional cards per game. Its reasonable 3/2 statline for 3 Energy makes it an efficient play even without immediate synergies.

### Code Manipulator (Unit)

A powerful mid-game unit that provides repeatable Override effects. While the activation costs 2 Energy, the extended duration (until your next turn) provides significant value by denying the opponent their unit for a full turn cycle. This creates difficult decision points for your opponent when deploying important units.

### System Breach (Action)

One of your most flexible Override effects, capable of targeting larger threats than most other Override cards. The power boost provided to the controlled unit creates efficient attack opportunities, either for removing enemy threats or dealing direct damage to the opponent.

### Master Algorithm (Condition)

A powerful late-game engine that transforms your Override strategy into Momentum generation while simultaneously weakening enemy units permanently. Once established, this can quickly generate enough Momentum to fuel Cypher's devastating Ultimate ability.

## Key Synergies

### Override Engine

Protocol Disruptor → System Analyst → Multiple Overrides
Establish the card-drawing System Analyst, then chain multiple Override effects to generate card advantage while controlling the board. This creates a snowball effect where each Override fuels further actions.

### Control Lockdown

System Lockdown → Energy Drain → Full System Reset
Create a resource disadvantage for your opponent with System Lockdown and Energy Drain, then reset the board when your opponent has committed resources. The increased cost to replay units after the reset creates a devastating tempo swing.

### Override Enhancement

Master Control Unit → Code Manipulator → System Breach
With Master Control Unit in play, your Override effects last an additional turn. This turns Code Manipulator and System Breach into extended control tools that can lock down the opponent's key units for multiple turns.

### Ultimate Setup

Ongoing Intrusion → Multiple Overrides → Master Algorithm → Master Program
Generate Momentum through consistent Override effects enhanced by Master Algorithm, then unleash Cypher's Ultimate for a devastating board swing that can often lead directly to victory.

## Game Plan

### Early Game (Turns 1-3)

- Deploy early information-gathering units like Data Miner and System Scout
- Use Protocol Disruptor to control early enemy threats
- Establish board protection with Firewall
- Consider playing Ongoing Intrusion for long-term Override value

### Mid Game (Turns 4-6)

- Deploy System Analyst to begin generating card advantage from Overrides
- Use Code Manipulator for extended control of key enemy threats
- Disrupt opponent's energy with Energy Drain at critical moments
- Use Redirect Protocol to position enemy units unfavorably

### Late Game (Turns 7+)

- Deploy powerful control pieces like Master Control Unit
- Establish Master Algorithm to maximize Override value
- Consider Full System Reset when the opponent has committed significant resources
- Prepare for Cypher's Ultimate by weakening enemy units to 3 or less Attack

## Matchup Advice

### Against Solaris Nexus "Radiant Dawn"

- Focus on Overriding their blessing-granting units like Dawn Priest
- Use Energy Drain when they're trying to set up multiple blessings in one turn
- Save System Breach for their high-value Radiant Knight or Light's Champion
- Use Full System Reset to counter their board-wide blessing strategies

### Against Umbral Eclipse "Shadow's Embrace"

- Override their corruption-enabling units like Darkness Cultivator
- Use Firewall to reduce the effectiveness of their Elusive attackers
- Save Quick Hack for their key cards like Eclipse or Shadow Master
- Deploy System Lockdown to hamper their Shadow Step abilities

### Against Primordial Genesis "Evolutionary Surge"

- Prioritize Overriding their evolution catalyst units before they evolve
- Use System Breach to temporarily control their larger evolved units
- Deploy Virus Program to weaken multiple evolved units simultaneously
- Save Full System Reset for when they've committed to multiple evolutions

## Upgrade Path

As your collection grows, consider these improvements to the Protocol Override deck:

### Priority Additions

1. **Neural Hijacker** (Rare Unit): 3-cost 2/3 with "When played, Override an enemy unit until your next turn. While you control it, it gets +1/+1."
2. **Complete Override** (Rare Action): 3-cost "Override an enemy unit with 4 or less Attack until the end of the game. It gets -1/-1."
3. **Mainframe Access** (Epic Condition): 5-cost "Ongoing: At the start of your turn, look at your opponent's hand. You may play one card from their hand this turn by paying its Energy cost."

### Potential Replacements

1. Replace 1x Protocol Disruptor with 1x Neural Hijacker
2. Replace 1x System Breach with 1x Complete Override
3. Replace 1x Master Algorithm with 1x Mainframe Access

### Advanced Strategy Upgrades

As you become more familiar with the faction, consider building toward these more advanced archetypes:

- **System Control**: Maximize Override effects for complete board domination
- **Energy Denial**: Focus on restricting opponent's Energy while enhancing your own
- **Program Combo**: Build around specific combinations of Override effects for explosive turns

## Playing Tips for New Players

1. **Information Management**: Use Data Miner and Quick Hack to plan around opponent's cards
2. **Mode Selection**: Start in Infiltration Mode and switch to Disruption when controlling key units
3. **Energy Tracking**: Watch opponent's available Energy when planning Override effects
4. **Targeting Priority**: Focus Override effects on units with impactful abilities over pure stats
5. **Complex Decisions**: Practice deciding when to use Full System Reset for maximum impact
