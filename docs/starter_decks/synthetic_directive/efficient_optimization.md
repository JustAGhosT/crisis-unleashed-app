# Synthetic Directive Starter Deck: "Efficient Optimization"

## Deck Overview

The Synthetic Directive "Efficient Optimization" starter deck emphasizes the faction's focus on resource management, energy efficiency, and incremental advantage. This deck excels at generating additional Energy, recycling resources, and maximizing the value of every card played. The strategy revolves around establishing energy-generating engines, optimizing each turn's efficiency, and overwhelming the opponent with superior resource utilization.

**Core Playstyle**: Resource control with efficiency mechanics  
**Difficulty**: ★★★☆☆ (Intermediate)  
**Key Mechanics**: Energy Generation, Efficiency, Recycling, Optimization

## Hero Card

### Optimizer (Synthetic Directive)

**Health**: 25  
**Special Ability**: Efficiency Analysis - Once per turn, reduce the cost of a card in your hand by 1 if you played a card with the same cost this turn.  
**Passive**: The first time each turn you play two cards with the same cost, gain 1 Energy.  
**Ultimate (3 Momentum)**: Maximum Efficiency - For the rest of the game, the first card you play each turn costs 2 less.

**Hero Strategy**: Optimizer excels at reducing costs and generating additional resources. Plan your turns to play cards with matching costs to trigger the passive Energy generation. Use Efficiency Analysis to create cost reductions on key cards you want to play next. Save the Ultimate for mid-to-late game when you'll consistently benefit from the cost reduction on your first card each turn.

## Key Cards

### Efficiency Drone (Unit)

A crucial early game unit that encourages efficient Energy usage by rewarding you for ending turns with unused Energy. This creates interesting decision points where sometimes it's better to hold Energy rather than deploy another unit. With multiple drones in play, you can generate significant card advantage.

### Resource Processor (Unit)

This 2-cost unit provides an Energy rebate when you play additional cards, effectively reducing their cost. While the effect is limited to once per turn, it creates a continuous advantage as the game progresses. Its reasonable 2/2 statline makes it an efficient early play.

### Energy Converter (Unit)

A powerful engine piece that amplifies all your Energy-generating effects. This unit creates a snowball effect where each Energy gain becomes more significant, allowing for explosive turns when combined with multiple Energy-generating cards.

### Efficiency Matrix (Condition)

This ongoing effect provides consistent cost reduction on your second card each turn. Combined with your hero's Ultimate reducing the first card, you can eventually play two cards each turn at significantly reduced costs, creating tremendous efficiency.

### Energy Overload (Action)

A flexible card that provides both Energy generation and potential removal. The damage scales with your current Energy, making it devastating in the late game when you've accumulated significant resources. This dual-purpose card exemplifies the deck's focus on efficient resource usage.

## Key Synergies

### Energy Acceleration

Energy Collector → Energy Converter → Efficiency Director
This sequence establishes a powerful Energy generation engine. The initial Energy Collector provides immediate value, which is doubled by Energy Converter, and then further enhanced by Efficiency Director. This can generate massive Energy advantages in the mid-game.

### Card Advantage Engine

Efficiency Drone → Perfect Optimization → Calculated Efficiency
Establish multiple ways to draw cards through efficient Energy usage. Efficiency Drones reward unused Energy with cards, Perfect Optimization rewards perfect Energy expenditure, and Calculated Efficiency provides direct card draw with potential cost reduction.

### Resource Recycling

Recycling Unit → Resource Redistribution → Resource Manager
Create value from your own units by sacrificing them for Energy with Resource Redistribution, gaining additional Energy from Recycling Unit when units are destroyed, and converting excess cards to Energy with Resource Manager when needed.

### Ultimate Efficiency

Efficiency Matrix → Optimizer's Ultimate → Energy Flow
Combine these effects to dramatically reduce the cost of your cards. With Efficiency Matrix reducing your second card each turn and your hero's Ultimate reducing your first card, you can deploy multiple threats each turn while maintaining Energy for reactive plays.

## Game Plan

### Early Game (Turns 1-3)

- Deploy efficient Energy generators like Energy Collector and Efficiency Drone
- Establish Resource Processor to begin gaining Energy rebates
- Start optimizing your hand with Optimization Engineer
- Consider playing Efficiency Matrix or Energy Flow for long-term advantage

### Mid Game (Turns 4-6)

- Deploy Energy Converter to amplify your Energy generation
- Use Optimization Protocol for turns when you need to deploy multiple cards
- Begin recycling resources with Resource Redistribution as needed
- Focus on matching card costs to trigger your hero's passive ability

### Late Game (Turns 7+)

- Deploy powerful finishers like Energy Matrix to maximize your Energy capacity
- Use Resource Manager to convert excess cards to Energy
- Consider activating Optimizer's Ultimate when you can consistently benefit from it
- Look for finishing opportunities with Energy Overload's scaling damage

## Matchup Advice

### Against Solaris Nexus "Radiant Dawn"

- Focus on out-valuing their blessing effects with your superior resource generation
- Use Resource Redistribution to sacrifice units targeted by their removal
- Save Energy Overload for their key blessed units
- Establish Perfect Optimization to maintain consistent card advantage

### Against Umbral Eclipse "Shadow's Embrace"

- Maintain multiple units to minimize the impact of their targeted corruption
- Use your Energy advantage to deploy threats faster than they can corrupt them
- Save Calculated Efficiency to find answers to their evasive threats
- Consider sacrificing corrupted units with Resource Redistribution for value

### Against Infernal Core "Burning Vengeance"

- Focus on maintaining your health through efficient trading rather than unit sacrifice
- Use your resource advantage to deploy multiple smaller threats instead of committing to a single large unit
- Save Energy Burst for turns when you need to deploy multiple defensive options
- Establish Energy Flow early to offset their aggressive resource denial

## Upgrade Path

As your collection grows, consider these improvements to the Efficient Optimization deck:

### Priority Additions

1. **Energy Nexus** (Rare Unit): 3-cost 2/4 with "At the start of your turn, gain Energy equal to the number of Energy you had left unspent last turn."
2. **Perfect Calculation** (Rare Action): 3-cost "Look at the top 8 cards of your deck. Put three into your hand that share the same cost. Shuffle the rest back."
3. **Optimal Configuration** (Epic Condition): 5-cost "Ongoing: Cards that cost the same as at least one other card in your hand cost 2 less Energy to play."

### Potential Replacements

1. Replace 1x Recycling Unit with 1x Energy Nexus
2. Replace 1x Calculated Efficiency with 1x Perfect Calculation
3. Replace 1x Perfect Optimization with 1x Optimal Configuration

### Advanced Strategy Upgrades

As you become more familiar with the faction, consider building toward these more advanced archetypes:

- **Energy Storm**: Focus on massive Energy generation for explosive turns
- **Efficiency Control**: Use resource advantages to deploy multiple answers to every threat
- **Cost Reduction Combo**: Build around reducing costs to play multiple high-impact cards in a single turn

## Playing Tips for New Players

1. **Turn Planning**: Plan your turns carefully to match card costs for your hero's passive
2. **Energy Tracking**: Keep track of your predicted Energy for future turns
3. **Efficiency Calculation**: Calculate whether it's better to spend all Energy or save some for Efficiency Drone
4. **Hand Management**: Keep cards with matching costs for potential cost reduction
5. **Sequencing**: Play cards in the correct order to maximize resource generation
