# Umbral Eclipse Starter Deck: "Void Corruption"

## Deck Overview

The Umbral Eclipse "Void Corruption" starter deck exemplifies the faction's mastery of shadow manipulation and control through corruption effects. This deck specializes in gradually weakening enemy units through stacking debuffs while drawing power from the void. The strategy revolves around widespread corruption, attrition-based gameplay, and powerful void entities that thrive in corrupted environments.

**Core Playstyle**: Control-attrition with corruption scaling  
**Difficulty**: ★★★★☆ (Advanced Intermediate)  
**Key Mechanics**: Corruption, Void Drain, Shadow Control, Attrition

## Hero Card

### Voidcaller (Umbral Eclipse)

**Health**: 25  
**Special Ability**: Corrupt Essence - Once per turn, Corrupt an enemy unit. If it was already Corrupted, draw a card.  
**Passive**: The first time each turn an enemy unit becomes Corrupted, restore 1 Health to your Hero.  
**Ultimate (5 Momentum)**: Void Collapse - All Corrupted enemy units are destroyed. For each unit destroyed this way, summon a 1/1 Shadow Essence with Elusive.

**Hero Strategy**: Voidcaller excels at gradually taking over the game through persistent corruption effects. Use Corrupt Essence every turn to weaken key threats while maintaining health through the Passive ability. The Ultimate serves as a powerful board clear that also rebuilds your board position. Focus on corruption-enabling cards early to maximize value from your hero's abilities.

## Key Cards

### Shadow Emissary (Unit)

A critical early game unit that begins generating value immediately. While it can't attack due to 0 Attack, its ability to passively corrupt enemy units each turn makes it an essential engine piece. Protect this unit to establish consistent corruption.

### Corruption Spreader (Unit)

A flexible unit that can corrupt multiple enemies at once. Strategic placement is key - try to position it where it can affect two enemy units simultaneously. Works especially well with cards that benefit from widespread corruption.

### Shadow Manipulator (Unit)

Offers unprecedented flexibility in your corruption strategy. Use it to concentrate multiple corruption effects on a single high-value target, or spread effects more evenly across the enemy board. Particularly valuable against decks that try to play around corruption by sacrificing specific units.

### Void Infection (Action)

One of your most efficient corruption engines. The delayed spread effect allows you to set up powerful board-wide corruption that synergizes with your other effects. Particularly devastating when combined with Void Presence or Lingering Corruption.

### Void Dominion (Condition)

A powerful late-game engine that turns your corruption strategy into Momentum generation while also limiting the opponent's options. Once established, this creates a snowball effect where each corrupted unit that falls fuels your hero's Ultimate ability.

## Key Synergies

### Corruption Engine

Shadow Emissary → Lingering Corruption → Void Presence
This combination establishes a powerful passive engine that corrupts enemy units each turn, weakens them steadily, and deals damage when corruption is applied. Creates tremendous pressure without requiring additional card investment.

### Health Manipulation

Void Leech → Essence Theft → Shadow's Embrace
Establishes an effective health gain engine that turns your corruption strategy into sustainable health advantage. Particularly effective against aggressive decks.

### Corruption Scaling

Corruption Spreader → Void Infection → Corruption Lord
Rapidly corrupts multiple enemy units, then doubles the effectiveness with Corruption Lord. This combination can quickly render the opponent's board ineffective.

### Ultimate Setup

Void Dominion → Widespread Corruption → Void Collapse
Generate Momentum through corrupting and destroying units, then unleash Voidcaller's Ultimate for a devastating board clear that also rebuilds your position with multiple 1/1 Elusive units.

## Game Plan

### Early Game (Turns 1-2)

- Deploy Shadow Emissary to begin passive corruption
- Use Void Harbinger as an efficient early unit that scales with corruption
- Begin applying corruption to key enemy threats with Shadow Tendril
- Consider playing a Void Presence or Lingering Corruption to enhance your corruption engine

### Mid Game (Turns 3-5)

- Deploy Corruption Spreader to expand your corruption reach
- Use Shadow Manipulator to optimize corruption placement
- Begin draining life from corrupted units with Essence Theft and Void Leech
- Use Corrupt Awakening to remove key corrupted threats

### Late Game (Turns 6+)

- Deploy powerful finishers like Void Abomination and Corruption Lord
- Set up for Void Consumption to gain Energy advantage in the late game
- Use Essence Collapse as a board clear against widespread corrupted units
- Consider activating Voidcaller's Ultimate when multiple enemy units are corrupted
