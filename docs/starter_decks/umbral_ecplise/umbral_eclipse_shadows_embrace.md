# Umbral Eclipse Starter Deck: "Shadow's Embrace"

## Deck Overview

The Umbral Eclipse "Shadow's Embrace" starter deck embodies the faction's focus on deception, shadow manipulation, and corruption. This deck excels at evading enemy defenses, controlling through subtle corruption effects, and striking from unexpected angles. The strategy revolves around shadow units that can bypass enemy defenses, gradually corrupting the game state, and setting up devastating surprise attacks.

**Core Playstyle**: Evasive control with corruption mechanics  
**Difficulty**: ★★★☆☆ (Intermediate)  
**Key Mechanics**: Corrupt, Shadow Step, Elusive, Void Touch

## Hero Card

### Shade (Umbral Eclipse)

**Health**: 24  
**Special Ability**: Shadow Shift - Once per turn, you may move one of your units to a different lane. If that unit is Corrupted, it gains +1/+0 until end of turn.  
**Passive**: Units with Elusive that you control cost 1 less Energy to play.  
**Ultimate (3 Momentum)**: Consuming Dark - Corrupt all enemy units. All Corrupted units take 1 damage.

**Hero Strategy**: Shade excels at maneuvering around the opponent's defenses and enhancing corrupted units. Use Shadow Shift regularly to reposition key units for optimal attacks or to escape defenders. The passive ability encourages playing Elusive units efficiently, while the Ultimate provides both corruption spread and potential board clear against already corrupted units.

## Key Cards

### Shadow Initiate (Unit)

This humble 1-cost unit provides early momentum generation by slipping past defenses with Elusive. Thanks to Shade's passive ability, it effectively costs 0 Energy, making it an ideal turn 1 play. Look for opportunities to attack the enemy hero directly to generate Momentum.

### Shadowcaster (Unit)

A critical enabler of your corruption synergies, this unit applies Corrupt immediately upon entry. While fragile at only 1 Health, it enables many of your more powerful effects that trigger off Corrupted units.

### Void Walker (Unit)

The epitome of shadow mobility, this unit can move to any lane once per turn. Use it to escape blockers, attack a vulnerable lane, or position for next turn's attacks. Combined with Shade's Shadow Shift ability, you can potentially move this unit twice in one turn.

### Void Touch (Action)

One of the most efficient corruption cards, applying both the Corrupt status and a permanent attack reduction. The attack reduction is especially valuable against high-attack enemy units that might otherwise trade favorably with your evasive but lower-health units.

### Shadow Realm (Condition)

A powerful ongoing effect that punishes corruption with additional damage. This turns your corruption effects into pseudo-removal spells, adding direct damage to their debuffing effects.

## Key Synergies

### Evasion Combo

Void Scout → Shroud of Darkness → Umbral Assassin/Void Stalker
This sequence establishes board knowledge through Void Scout's ability, enhances your evasive units with Shroud of Darkness, then deploys powerful Elusive attackers that can bypass defenses for direct damage.

### Corruption Chain

Shadowcaster → Corruption Spread → Shadow Strike
Apply Corruption with Shadowcaster, amplify its effects with Corruption Spread, then capitalize with Shadow Strike for removal plus card draw, creating both board advantage and card advantage.

### Mobility Tactics

Dark Passage → Void Walker → Shadow Shift
Create unpredictable attack angles by moving units across the board, evading defenders and striking vulnerable lanes. This combination makes blocking nearly impossible for your opponent.

### Ultimate Setup

Shadowcaster/Darkness Cultivator → Multiple Corruptions → Consuming Dark
Establish corruption on multiple enemy units, then follow with Shade's Ultimate ability for widespread corruption and damage, potentially clearing the board or setting up lethal damage.

## Game Plan

### Early Game (Turns 1-2)

- Deploy evasive units like Shadow Initiate to start generating Momentum
- Use Void Scout to gain information about the opponent's upcoming draws
- Apply early Corruption with Shadowcaster to start weakening enemy units
- Consider playing Shroud of Darkness on turn 2 to enhance future Elusive units

### Mid Game (Turns 3-5)

- Deploy Void Walker and use its mobility to attack advantageous lanes
- Play Darkness Cultivator to start spreading Corruption passively
- Use Dark Passage to create unexpected attack angles
- Start establishing Corruption-based card advantage with Shadow Strike

### Late Game (Turns 6+)

- Deploy powerful finishers like Shadow Master to amplify Corruption effects
- Use Shade's Ultimate ability when multiple enemy units are already Corrupted
- Play Eclipse as a board clear against developed enemy boards
- Look for lethal damage opportunities with evasive attackers enhanced by Shroud

## Matchup Advice

### Against Solaris Nexus "Radiant Dawn"

- Focus on Corrupting their Blessed units to negate their buffs
- Use Elusive units to bypass their Defender units
- Save Shadow Strike for their key synergy units like Dawn Priest
- Play around Solar Flare by not overextending your board

### Against Synthetic Directive "Calculated Assembly"

- Target their upgrade engine units with Corruption effects
- Use Elusive units to bypass their defensive line
- Save Eclipse for when they've committed multiple upgraded units
- Deploy Shadow Master to prevent them from corrupting your key units

### Against Primordial Genesis "Evolutionary Surge"

- Prioritize Corrupting their evolving units early before they grow too large
- Use mobility to avoid their larger units
- Save Soul Drain for when multiple evolved units are Corrupted
- Deploy Shadow Realm to punish their wide-board strategy

## Upgrade Path

As your collection grows, consider these improvements to the Shadow's Embrace deck:

### Priority Additions

1. **Void Assassin** (Rare Unit): 3-cost 3/2 with "Elusive. When this deals damage to a Corrupted enemy, destroy that enemy."
2. **Shadow Manipulation** (Rare Action): 2-cost "Move an enemy unit to any lane. Corrupt it."
3. **Eternal Night** (Epic Condition): 4-cost "Ongoing: At the end of your turn, all Corrupted units take damage equal to the number of Corruption effects on them."

### Potential Replacements

1. Replace 1x Void Walker with 1x Void Assassin
2. Replace 1x Dark Passage with 1x Shadow Manipulation
3. Replace 1x Corruption Spread with 1x Eternal Night

### Advanced Strategy Upgrades

As you become more familiar with the faction, consider building toward these more advanced archetypes:

- **Shadow Aggro**: Focus on multiple Elusive units with attack enhancements for rapid damage

- **Void Combo**: Build around Shadow Master and mass Corruption for devastating late-game turns

## Playing Tips for New Players

1. **Information Advantage**: Use Void Scout to plan around your opponent's upcoming draws
2. **Lane Positioning**: Don't keep all units in the same lane; spread out to maximize mobility options
3. **Corruption Tracking**: Keep track of which enemy units are Corrupted for synergy effects
4. **Energy Management**: Leverage Shade's passive to play Elusive units more efficiently
5. **Momentum Planning**: Build Momentum for Shade's Ultimate as a potential board clear
