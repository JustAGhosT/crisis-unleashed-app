# Umbral Eclipse Starter Decks

The Umbral Eclipse faction offers three distinct starter deck variants, each highlighting different aspects of the faction's shadow manipulation and deception mechanics. Players can roll a die to randomly select one of these decks, or choose the approach that best fits their playstyle.

1. [**Shadow's Embrace**](./umbral_eclipse_shadows_embrace.md) - Focuses on evasive units with corruption mechanics
2. [**Night's Vengeance**](./umbral_eclipse_nights_vengeance.md) - Emphasizes stealth mechanics with burst damage
3. [**Void Corruption**](./umbral_eclipse_void_corruption.md) - Specializes in widespread corruption with control elements

Each deck provides a unique pathway into mastering the Umbral Eclipse faction while maintaining balanced gameplay against other starter decks. Choose your path into the shadows carefully.
