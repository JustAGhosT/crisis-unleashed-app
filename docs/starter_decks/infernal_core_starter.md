# Infernal Core Starter Deck: "Burning Vengeance"

## Deck Overview

The Infernal Core "Burning Vengeance" starter deck embodies the faction's focus on destruction, sacrifice, and devastating power. This deck excels at trading resources for overwhelming advantages, burning away obstacles, and unleashing chaos on the battlefield. The strategy revolves around sacrificing your own units for powerful effects, dealing direct damage, and punishing opponents with revenge mechanics when your units are destroyed.

**Core Playstyle**: Aggressive sacrifice with direct damage mechanics  
**Difficulty**: ★★★☆☆ (Intermediate)  
**Key Mechanics**: Sacrifice, Vengeance, Immolate, Burn

## Hero Card

### Inferno (Infernal Core)

**Health**: 22  
**Special Ability**: Consume - Once per turn, sacrifice a unit you control to deal damage equal to its Attack to any target and gain 1 Momentum.  
**Passive**: Whenever a unit you control is sacrificed, all enemy units take 1 damage.  
**Ultimate (3 Momentum)**: Infernal Wrath - Deal 3 damage to all enemy units. You take damage equal to the number of your units that died this turn.

**Hero Strategy**: Inferno rewards aggressive sacrifice-based play. Use Consume regularly to convert your units into direct damage while generating Momentum. The passive ability makes wide sacrifices even more impactful by damaging all enemy units. The Ultimate provides a powerful board clear, but requires careful timing to minimize self-damage from your own sacrifices in the same turn.

## Key Cards

### Ember Imp (Unit)

A crucial early unit that ensures value even when sacrificed by dealing direct damage to the enemy hero. While modest, the cumulative effect of multiple sacrificed Imps can deal significant damage over the course of the game. Their low cost makes them perfect sacrifice fodder for more powerful effects.

### Infernal Acolyte (Unit)

A key engine piece that grows stronger with each sacrifice you make, turning your sacrifice strategy into board presence. With proper protection, a single Acolyte can grow into a major threat while you execute your sacrifice strategy.

### Sacrifice Engine (Unit)

A critical card advantage engine, allowing you to convert units into card draw. Its 4 health makes it relatively resilient, and it can single-handedly solve resource problems in the mid to late game.

### Vengeance Pact (Condition)

A powerful ongoing effect that punishes opponents for removing your units, creating a lose-lose situation where they either allow your units to remain or take damage for removing them. This card is particularly effective against control strategies.

### Doom Harbinger (Unit)

Your top-end finisher that can provide immediate impact upon entry by sacrificing units for significant direct damage. Use this to clear problem units or deal the final points of damage to the enemy hero.

## Key Synergies

### Sacrifice Value Chain

Ember Imp → Sacrifice Engine → Inferno's Passive
This combination turns each sacrificed Imp into card draw plus 1 damage to all enemy units plus 1 damage to the enemy hero, creating exceptional resource efficiency.

### Vengeance Combo

Vengeful Spirit → Vengeance Pact → Opponent Removal
This combination punishes opponent removal doubly - the Spirit deals 3 damage to the unit that destroyed it, while Vengeance Pact deals 2 damage to the enemy hero. This creates a deterrent against opponent interaction.

### Growth Through Sacrifice

Infernal Acolyte → Multiple Sacrifice Effects → Large Threat
Establish one or more Acolytes, then execute your sacrifice strategy to grow them into major threats. With multiple Acolytes, each sacrifice compounds in value.

### Ultimate Setup

Wide Board → Sacrificial Altar → Inferno's Ultimate
Establish a board presence, enhance sacrifice triggers with Sacrificial Altar, then unleash Inferno's Ultimate for maximum damage to all enemy units.

## Game Plan

### Early Game (Turns 1-3)

- Deploy early units like Ember Imp and Flame Scout
- Begin establishing sacrifice engines with Infernal Acolyte
- Use Immolate for early removal while setting up sacrifice synergies
- Consider playing Burning Ground in a contested lane

### Mid Game (Turns 4-6)

- Deploy Sacrifice Engine to maintain card advantage
- Use Hellfire as a board clear when advantageous
- Establish Vengeance Pact to punish opponent removal
- Look for opportunities to use Inferno's Consume ability for direct damage

### Late Game (Turns 7+)

- Deploy Doom Harbinger for a large tempo swing
- Use accumulated Momentum for Inferno's Ultimate as a potential game-ender
- Convert remaining resources into direct damage with various sacrifice outlets
- Look for lethal damage with combinations of direct damage effects

## Matchup Advice

### Against Solaris Nexus "Radiant Dawn"
