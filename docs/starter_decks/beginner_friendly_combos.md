## Cross-Faction Combo Potential

While starter decks focus on single-faction play, these combos hint at the potential for cross-faction strategies in constructed play:

### Solaris + Primordial (Growth Synergy)

Blessing effects from Solaris could enhance units with Evolution counters from Primordial, creating super-charged evolved units.

### Umbral + Infernal (Sacrifice/Vengeance)

Shadow units could gain Vengeance effects, becoming threats whether they attack successfully or are destroyed.

### Aeonic + Synthetic (Construction Timeline)

Delay effects could be used to orchestrate precise assembly sequences, ensuring optimal module attachment timing.

### Neuralis + Umbral (Mind Shadow)

Information advantage from Neuralis could direct precise Shadow attacks and corruptions from Umbral.

## Practice Exercises

To master these combos, try these practice scenarios:

1. **Goldfishing**: Play without an opponent and try to execute these combos by specific turn numbers
2. **Scenario Setup**: Arrange specific board states and practice executing the combos
3. **Combo Chains**: Try linking multiple combos together across several turns
4. **Resource Challenge**: Execute the combos with 1 less Energy than normal to practice efficiency

## Timing Considerations

Understanding the right moment to execute these combos is crucial:

1. **Development Combos**: Execute these in the early-mid game to establish advantages
2. **Response Combos**: Save these to counter specific opponent threats
3. **Finishing Combos**: Use these when they can secure lethal damage or insurmountable advantage
4. **Value Combos**: Prioritize these when running low on cards or resources

## Beyond Starter Decks

As you expand your collection beyond starter decks, look for these combo patterns:

1. **Enabler + Payoff**: Cards that create a state + cards that benefit from that state
2. **Multiplier + Resource**: Cards that multiply effects + high-value resources to multiply
3. **Protection + Engine**: Cards that protect + cards that generate ongoing value
4. **Setup + Finisher**: Cards that prepare the board + cards that capitalize for massive damage
