# Primordial Genesis Starter Deck: "Evolutionary Surge"

## Deck Overview

The Primordial Genesis "Evolutionary Surge" starter deck embodies the faction's connection to nature, evolution, and adaptive growth. This deck excels at deploying units that grow stronger over time, adapt to different situations, and thrive through environmental synergies. The strategy revolves around starting with modest units that evolve into powerhouses, terraforming the battlefield to your advantage, and overwhelming opponents with continuously improving creatures.

**Core Playstyle**: Adaptive midrange with evolution mechanics  
**Difficulty**: ★★★☆☆ (Intermediate)  
**Key Mechanics**: Evolve, Adapt, Terraform, Growth

## Hero Card

### Genesis (Primordial Genesis)

**Health**: 28  
**Special Ability**: Catalyze - Once per turn, place an Evolution counter on a unit you control. When that unit has 3 Evolution counters, transform it into an evolved form with +2/+2.  
**Passive**: When a unit you control evolves, heal your hero for 2.  
**Ultimate (4 Momentum)**: Primal Surge - Put an Evolution counter on all units you control and trigger any "when this evolves" effects.

**Hero Strategy**: Genesis excels at accelerating the evolution of your units. Use Catalyze regularly to advance your key units toward their evolved states. The passive healing helps sustain you through the mid-game while your board develops. Save the Ultimate for when you have multiple units with Evolution counters, ideally ones with powerful "when evolved" triggers, to create a massive board swing.

## Key Cards

### Evolution Guide (Unit)

This seemingly modest 1/3 unit is a critical engine piece, doubling the evolution speed of adjacent units. Position this unit strategically in the middle lane with evolving units on either side to maximize its effect. Protect it whenever possible as it accelerates your entire strategy.

### Growth Cultivator (Unit)

The snowball enabler of the deck, this unit compounds your evolution progress by adding counters to units that already have them. Once this is in play with multiple evolving units, your board can rapidly reach overwhelming strength.

### Natural Growth (Action)

A simple but efficient card that advances your evolution strategy while replacing itself. The flexibility to target any unit makes it valuable in all stages of the game, from accelerating early units to pushing key units toward evolution thresholds.

### Terraformed Habitat (Condition)

A powerful lane enhancement that provides immediate value to any unit played there and speeds up their evolution. Designate one lane as your primary development lane and use this to create a stronghold of increasingly powerful units.

### Genesis Behemoth (Unit)

Your top-end finisher that immediately advances all your other evolving units while presenting a large threat itself. When evolved, it provides card advantage to refill your hand for the late game.

## Key Synergies

### Evolution Acceleration

Evolution Guide → Growth Cultivator → Genesis's Catalyze
This combination rapidly accelerates evolution counters, potentially evolving multiple units in a single turn cycle. Position the Evolution Guide in the middle lane with Growth Cultivator adjacent to benefit from the doubled counter gain.

### Terraform Strategy

Wilderness Shaper → Terraformed Habitat → Unit Development
Establish a lane with both inherent Terraform effects from evolved Wilderness Shapers and the ongoing benefits of Terraformed Habitat, then focus unit development in that lane for maximum value.

### Adaptive Growth

Adaptive Sapling → Multiple Evolution Triggers → Snowballing Board
Deploy multiple Adaptive Saplings that continuously grow stronger as your other units evolve, creating a board that improves through multiple vectors simultaneously.

### Ultimate Combo

Multiple Partially-Evolved Units → Genesis's Ultimate → Adaptation
Set up multiple units with 1-2 Evolution counters, use Genesis's Ultimate to push them over the evolution threshold, then follow with Adaptation to trigger all their evolution effects again for massive value.

## Game Plan

### Early Game (Turns 1-3)

- Deploy early evolving units like Seedling Sprout
- Establish Evolution Guide to accelerate your strategy
- Use Natural Growth to advance key units and keep cards flowing
- Consider placing Fertile Ground to establish passive evolution progression

### Mid Game (Turns 4-6)

- Deploy Growth Cultivator to compound evolution advantages
- Establish lane control with Wilderness Shaper and Terraformed Habitat
- Use Primal Strike to leverage your evolved units for removal
- Begin developing your larger threats like Apex Predator or Ancient Guardian

### Late Game (Turns 7+)

- Deploy Genesis Behemoth to push your board toward completion
- Use Genesis's Ultimate when it will evolve multiple units
- Apply pressure with your evolved board across all lanes
- Consider Adaptation to re-trigger powerful evolution effects
- Close out with Nature's Wrath if the board is contested

## Matchup Advice

### Against Solaris Nexus "Radiant Dawn"

- Focus on evolving Ancient Guardian to counter their blessed units
- Use Primal Strike to remove their key blessing enablers
- Position Evolution Guide away from their direct removal spells
- Evolve units to outsize their blessed units in the late game

### Against Umbral Eclipse "Shadow's Embrace"

- Spread your units across lanes to limit their corruption spread
- Evolve Seedling Sprouts to gain regeneration against their damage-over-time effects
- Use Ancient Guardian to block their evasive units once evolved
- Maintain board presence to prevent their direct attacks

### Against Aeonic Dominion "Timeless Authority"

- Diversify your threats to avoid being completely disrupted by their delay effects
- Accelerate evolution to outpace their tempo disruption
- Use Primal Strike to remove their key engine pieces like Timekeeper
- Focus on evolving a wide board rather than a single large threat

## Upgrade Path

As your collection grows, consider these improvements to the Evolutionary Surge deck:

### Priority Additions

1. **Primal Colossus** (Rare Unit): 5-cost 3/5 with "When this evolves, it gains stats equal to all other evolved units you control."
2. **Accelerated Metabolism** (Rare Action): 3-cost "Place an Evolution counter on target unit, then double its current Evolution counters."
3. **Evolutionary Perfection** (Epic Condition): 5-cost "Ongoing: Your evolved units gain all keywords (Rush, Overwhelm, First Strike, Regenerate, etc.)."

### Potential Replacements

1. Replace 1x Wilderness Shaper with 1x Primal Colossus
2. Replace 1x Adaptation with 1x Accelerated Metabolism
3. Replace 1x Evolutionary Leap with 1x Evolutionary Perfection

### Advanced Strategy Upgrades

As you become more familiar with the faction, consider building toward these more advanced archetypes:

- **Hyper Evolution**: Focus on rapidly evolving a single massive threat
- **Swarm Evolution**: Develop numerous smaller evolving units for overwhelming board presence
- **Terraform Control**: Center strategy around controlling lanes with powerful terraform effects

## Playing Tips for New Players

1. **Counter Management**: Keep track of evolution counters and plan around evolution thresholds
2. **Positioning Matters**: Place Evolution Guide in the center of your evolving units
3. **Lane Commitment**: Dedicate one lane to your terraform and evolution synergies
4. **Patience Pays**: Sometimes it's better to set up multiple evolutions rather than triggering one immediately
5. **Hero Healing**: Remember that Genesis passively heals when units evolve, which can be crucial in close games
