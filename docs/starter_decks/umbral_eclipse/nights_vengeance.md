# Umbral Eclipse Starter Deck: "Night's Vengeance"

## Deck Overview

The Umbral Eclipse "Night's Vengeance" starter deck showcases the faction's focus on stealth, surprise attacks, and precision strike capability. This deck excels at hiding units until the perfect moment, then unleashing coordinated attacks from the shadows. The strategy revolves around maintaining a hidden presence on the battlefield, gathering intelligence, and striking when the opponent least expects it.

**Core Playstyle**: Stealth-combo with burst damage  
**Difficulty**: ★★★☆☆ (Intermediate)  
**Key Mechanics**: Stealth, Shadow Strike, Corruption, Void Pierce

## Hero Card

### Nightshade (Umbral Eclipse)

**Health**: 24  
**Special Ability**: Shadow Step - Once per turn, give a friendly unit Stealth until it attacks, or move a Stealthed unit to a different position.  
**Mode Switch**: Once per turn, transform between Infiltrator Mode and Corruptor Mode.  
**Infiltrator Mode**: Stealthed units you control gain +1 Attack and Pierce 1.  
**Corruptor Mode**: When your units corrupt enemy units, apply an additional -0/-1 effect.  
**Ultimate (4 Momentum)**: Umbral Veil - All friendly units gain Stealth. Draw a card for each unit that gained Stealth this way.

**Hero Strategy**: Nightshade offers tactical flexibility with its mode-switching ability. Start in Infiltrator Mode to enhance your Stealthed units' offensive capability. When facing larger enemy threats, switch to Corruptor Mode to weaken them more efficiently. Use Shadow Step to maneuver key units into optimal positions or reapply Stealth after attacking.

## Key Cards

### Void Whisperer (Unit)

This 2-cost unit provides valuable card advantage when it attacks from Stealth. Position it wisely and use Shadow Cloak to re-stealth it after attacks to generate ongoing value. The card draw helps you find your key pieces and maintain pressure.

### Shadow Assassin (Unit)

A key damage dealer that can deliver sudden burst damage when attacking from Stealth. With its base 3 Attack plus 2 bonus Attack from Stealth, it can deal 5 damage in a single strike - enough to remove many mid-game threats. When Nightshade is in Infiltrator Mode, this becomes even more deadly.

### Shadow Cloak (Action)

One of the most efficient cards in the deck, providing both Stealth and card draw for just 1 Energy. Save this for high-value targets like Void Whisperer or Shadow Assassin to maximize value. Can also be used defensively to protect threatened units.

### Shadow Assault (Action)

Your primary finisher and burst damage tool. This card enables a surprise alpha strike with all your Stealthed units, potentially dealing massive damage in a single turn. Time this carefully for when your opponent has overcommitted resources elsewhere.

### Shadow Dominion (Condition)

A powerful ongoing effect that increases the effectiveness of your corruption strategy. Once established, this card creates a win-win situation where you're either dealing increased damage to corrupted units or drawing cards when they're defeated.

## Key Synergies

### Stealth Card Draw Engine

Void Whisperer → Shadow Cloak → Attack from Stealth
This sequence creates a renewable source of card advantage. Each time Void Whisperer attacks from Stealth, you draw a card. Re-apply Stealth with Shadow Cloak to repeat the process.

### Stealth Burst Damage

Shadow Cloak → Multiple Stealthed units → Infiltrator Mode → Shadow Assault
Build up several units in Stealth, switch to Infiltrator Mode, then unleash Shadow Assault for a devastating alpha strike that can dramatically swing board position or deal lethal damage.

### Corruption Amplification

Void Corruptor → Dark Corruption → Nightmare Stalker → Shadow Dominion
Layer multiple corruption effects on key enemy units, then attack with Nightmare Stalker for massive damage. With Shadow Dominion in play, you'll either pierce through their defenses or draw cards if they're defeated.

### Positional Advantage

Darklight Infiltrator → Vanishing Mist → Shadow Step
Create unpredictable attack angles by manipulating unit positions across the board. This disrupts the opponent's blocking plans and opens lanes for direct damage.

## Game Plan

### Early Game (Turns 1-2)

- Deploy efficient early units: Shadow Initiate and Umbral Scout
- Use Umbral Scout to gain information about your opponent's upcoming draws
- Begin applying Stealth to key units with Shadow Cloak
- Consider playing Veil of Shadows on turn 2 for long-term value

### Mid Game (Turns 3-5)

- Start corrupting key enemy threats with Void Corruptor and Dark Corruption
- Build a board of Stealthed units while maintaining card advantage
- Use Darklight Infiltrator to position for optimal attacks
- Remove threatening enemy units with Void Strike

### Late Game (Turns 6+)

- Deploy powerful finishers like Nightmare Stalker and Shadow Mistress
- Use Shadow Assault for a surprise alpha strike against weakened enemies
- Maintain card advantage through corrupted unit removal with Shadow Dominion
- Consider using Nightshade's Ultimate when you have multiple units that would benefit from Stealth

## Matchup Advice

### Against Solaris Nexus "Radiant Dawn"

- Focus on corrupting their key blessing-granting units
- Use Stealth to avoid their area damage effects
- Save Shadow Assault for after they've deployed their defender units
- Maintain Corruptor Mode against their high-health blessed units

### Against Synthetic Directive "Calculated Assembly"

- Prioritize corrupting their upgraded units to negate their enhancement strategies
- Use Void Strike to remove their upgrade engine units early
- Maintain Infiltrator Mode to pierce through their enhanced defenses
- Save Corruption Wave for when they've committed multiple upgraded units

### Against Primordial Genesis "Evolutionary Surge"

- Focus on corrupting their evolving units before they grow too large
- Use Stealth to avoid their larger evolved units
- Maintain Corruptor Mode to keep their growth in check
- Position your units carefully to avoid their area effects

## Upgrade Path

2. **Umbral Ambush** (Rare Action): 2-cost "Give all your units Stealth until they attack. Stealthed units you control gain +1/+0 until end of turn."
3. **Nightmare Realm** (Epic Condition): 4-cost "Ongoing: Whenever a unit gains Stealth, draw a card. Whenever a Stealthed unit attacks, it gains +1/+0."

### Potential Replacements

1. Replace 1x Corrupting Shade with 1x Shadowfiend
2. Replace 1x Vanishing Mist with 1x Umbral Ambush
3. Replace 1x Corrupting Presence with 1x Nightmare Realm

### Advanced Strategy Upgrades

As you become more familiar with the faction, consider building toward these more advanced archetypes:

- **Stealth Burst**: Maximize Stealth units with burst damage potential
- **Shadow Control**: Focus on Stealth combined with corruption for a controlling approach
- **Nightshade Combo**: Build specifically around leveraging both of Nightshade's modes flexibly

## Playing Tips for New Players

1. **Mode Management**: Track which mode Nightshade is in and switch at optimal times
2. **Stealth Tracking**: Remember which units are Stealthed for synergy effects
3. **Card Draw Planning**: Maximize value from Void Whisperer and Shadow Cloak
4. **Opponent Information**: Use Umbral Scout to plan your moves based on what's coming
5. **Burst Damage Calculation**: Before using Shadow Assault, calculate potential damage output
