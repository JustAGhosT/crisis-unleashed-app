# Infernal Core Starter Decks

*Note: Full development of these decks has been postponed, but this template outlines the planned structure.*

## Overview

The Infernal Core faction specializes in demonic technology, sacrifice mechanics, and high-risk strategies. Their units tap into chaotic energy, offering tremendous power at significant costs, creating explosive but potentially self-destructive gameplay.

## Planned Starter Decks

### Chaos Engine

**Theme**: Unpredictable but powerful effects

- **Key Mechanic**: Random powerful effects with risk factors
- **Strategy**: Embrace chaos and adapt to unpredictable outcomes
- **Core Cards**: Chaos Matrix, Probability Warper, Unstable Reactor

### Blood Sacrifice

**Theme**: Power through pain and sacrifice

- **Key Mechanic**: Sacrifice resources, cards, or health for power
- **Strategy**: Calculate the right sacrifices to maximize gain
- **Core Cards**: Blood Pact Engine, Demon Forge, Soul Harvester

### Infernal Technomancy

**Theme**: Demonic technology fusion

- **Key Mechanic**: Corrupted technological artifacts and enhancements
- **Strategy**: Enhance units with powerful but dangerous upgrades
- **Core Cards**: Demon Core, Corrupted Implants, Tech Possession

## Faction Strengths

- Highest potential power ceiling of any faction
- Excellent at explosive comebacks
- Strong burst damage and removal options

## Faction Weaknesses

- Self-damaging effects can backfire
- Inconsistent performance due to random elements
- Resource management challenges

## Synergies with Other Factions

- **Primordial Genesis**: Sacrifice fodder for powerful effects
- **Umbral Eclipse**: Shadow manipulation enhances demonic rituals
- **Solaris Nexus**: Opposing forces create interesting risk/protection dynamics
