## Key Cards

### Dawn Priest (Unit)

This 2-cost unit is the deck's primary "engine" card, blessing other units upon entry. This enables your blessing synergies right away, making it an ideal turn 2 play. Try to protect your Dawn Priests, as they continue to provide value as you play more units.

### Light-Forged Defender (Unit)

A crucial defensive unit that becomes extremely durable when blessed, reaching 1/5 stats with a single blessing. Position these in your front lane to protect other valuable units like Dawn Priest and Solar Engineer.

### Radiant Knight (Unit)

A strong mid-game unit that both defends your board and enhances your blessed units' offensive capabilities. This card represents the transition from setting up your board to applying pressure on your opponent.

### Solar Blessing (Action)

Perhaps the most efficient card in the deck, providing both a blessing effect and card draw for just 1 Energy. Save this for high-value blessing targets when possible.

### Sunlit Battlefield (Condition)

A key ongoing effect that provides consistent value each turn. Play this as early as possible for maximum benefit, preferably on turn 2 or 3.

## Key Synergies

### Blessing Chain

Dawn Priest → Light-Forged Defender → Radiant Knight
This sequence creates a powerful defensive wall while setting up offensive capabilities. The Knight enhances the Blessed Defender, creating a mutually beneficial relationship.

### Offensive Empowerment

Solar Blessing → Light's Champion → Attack
Blessing the Champion gives it Rush, allowing for an immediate attack. This creates a potential 6 damage from hand for just 5 Energy (4+1) when you need a sudden burst of damage.

### Value Generation

Sunlit Battlefield → Solar Engineer → Repeated Blessings
This combination creates an engine that blesses units every turn, both automatically and by using your excess Energy, quickly building an overwhelming advantage.

### Board Clear

Dawn Priest → Multiple Units → Solar Flare
Build a blessed board of units with enhanced health, then clear your opponent's smaller units with Solar Flare, which also gives your units more survivability.

## Game Plan

### Early Game (Turns 1-2)

- Play efficient early units: Sunfire Initiate and Solar Scout
- Use Solar Scout to set up your next draw
- Play Dawn Priest on turn 2 if possible to start blessing effects
- Consider playing Sunlit Battlefield on turn 2 for long-term value

### Mid Game (Turns 3-5)

- Establish defensive line with Light-Forged Defender and Radiant Knight
- Start applying pressure with Sunray Harrier's direct damage
- Use Solar Engineer to continue blessing your growing board
- Play Radiant Beam to remove threatening enemy units

### Late Game (Turns 6+)

- Deploy powerful finishers like Solar Oracle to bless your entire board
- Use The Herald's Ultimate ability when you have a wide board
- Clear the opponent's board with Solar Flare then attack for lethal damage
- Use Dawn's Renewal to heal your hero if the game goes long

## Matchup Advice

### Against Umbral Eclipse "Shadow's Embrace"

- Prioritize Light-Forged Defenders to block their evasive units
- Save Radiant Beam for their key shadow units
- Switch to Guardian Form to protect against their burst damage
- Use Solar Flare to clear multiple shadow units

### Against Primordial Genesis "Evolutionary Surge"

- Focus on removing their early evolving units before they grow too large
- Block their lanes with Defender units
- Use Solar Blessing to outpace their evolution mechanics
- Save Solar Flare for when they've committed multiple growing units

### Against Infernal Core "Burning Vengeance"

- Stay in Guardian Form to mitigate their aggressive damage
- Use Dawn's Renewal to offset early damage
- Establish Light-Forged Defenders to block their attacks
- Don't overextend into their board clear effects

2. **Form Management**: Start in Radiant Form and switch to Guardian when you need protection
3. **Blessing Sequencing**: Plan your blessings to maximize synergies between units
4. **Energy Efficiency**: Use Solar Engineer's ability at the end of your opponent's turn if you have leftover Energy
