# Solaris Nexus Starter Deck: "Light's Judgment"

## Deck Overview

The Solaris Nexus "Light's Judgment" starter deck showcases the faction's focus on direct damage, light channeling, and swift justice. This deck excels at controlling the board through focused light attacks and disciplined unit deployment. The strategy revolves around channeling solar energy to deal direct damage while gradually building a balanced board of radiant units capable of coordinated strikes.

**Core Playstyle**: Burn control with direct damage focus  
**Difficulty**: ★★★☆☆ (Intermediate)  
**Key Mechanics**: Channel, Radiance, Judgment, Purify

## Hero Card

### Solus (Solaris Nexus)

**Health**: 25  
**Special Ability**: Channel Light - Once per turn, deal 1 damage to any target. If you dealt damage this way to an enemy unit this turn, gain 1 Momentum.  
**Passive**: The first time each turn you play a card with "Radiant" or "Solar" in its name, gain 1 Energy.  
**Ultimate (4 Momentum)**: Solar Judgment - Deal 3 damage to all enemy units. Your hero restores Health equal to the damage dealt this way.

**Hero Strategy**: Solus excels at consistent damage output and resource generation. Use Channel Light every turn to pick off small threats or finish damaged units while generating Momentum. The passive ability rewards you for playing on-theme cards, effectively reducing their cost. Save the Ultimate for when the opponent has multiple units to maximize its value, especially when you need the healing effect.

## Key Cards

### Dawn Channeler (Unit)

This 2-cost unit provides repeatable direct damage, acting as an engine for your damage-based strategies. Though the effect costs Energy each activation, it provides tremendous flexibility in picking off small units or finishing wounded ones. This unit enables multiple synergies with your damage-trigger effects.

### Light Judge (Unit)

A key support unit that weakens enemy units when they take damage from your abilities. This reduces the opponent's offensive capabilities while maintaining your board control. The 1/3 statline provides reasonable durability for its cost, allowing it to remain on the board to provide its effect multiple times.

### Sunray Oracle (Unit)

A critical card advantage engine that rewards you for dealing damage with abilities. Paired with your hero power and other damage effects, this can generate multiple extra cards per game. Time its deployment carefully to maximize card draws in the mid-game.

### Radiant Judgment (Action)

An efficient removal option that becomes even more powerful when targeting units that have already been damaged. This creates a natural sequence of small damage effects (like Channel Light) followed by Radiant Judgment for maximum value.

### Solar Amplifier (Condition)

A powerful ongoing effect that enhances all your damage-dealing abilities. This transforms small ping effects into significant threats and makes your larger damage spells truly devastating. Play this around turn 3-4 when you can start to capitalize on the enhanced damage.

## Key Synergies

### Damage Amplification

Solar Amplifier → Dawn Channeler → Multiple Activations
This combination turns the modest 1 damage from Dawn Channeler into 2 damage per activation, significantly increasing its efficiency. This can quickly clear smaller enemy units or pile damage onto larger threats.

### Card Draw Engine

Sunray Oracle → Channel Light → Dawn Channeler
Establish Sunray Oracle, then use your hero ability and Dawn Channeler to trigger multiple card draws in a single turn. This creates a powerful card advantage engine while simultaneously controlling the board.

### Finishing Sequence

Channel Light → Radiant Judgment → Dawn's Verdict
Damage an enemy unit with Channel Light, then follow with Radiant Judgment for enhanced damage, and finish with Dawn's Verdict for a potential 9 total damage to a single target (with Solar Amplifier in play).

### Ultimate Setup

Persistent Radiance → Multiple Damage Effects → Solar Judgment
Establish Persistent Radiance to start damaging enemy units each turn, layer additional damage to weaken multiple enemies, then finish with Solar Judgment for a devastating board clear that also provides substantial healing.

## Game Plan

### Early Game (Turns 1-2)

- Deploy efficient early units like Solar Scout and Radiant Initiate
- Use Solar Scout to set up your next draw, looking for key damage cards
- Begin dealing damage with Channel Light to generate Momentum
- Deploy Dawn Channeler on turn 2 if possible to start your damage engine

### Mid Game (Turns 3-5)

- Establish board control with Radiance Adept's entry damage
- Deploy Sunray Oracle and start generating card advantage
- Play Solar Amplifier to enhance your damage output
- Use Radiant Judgment and Dawn's Verdict to remove key threats

### Late Game (Turns 6+)

- Deploy powerful finishers like Daybreak Vindicator and Solar Purifier
- Use Solus's Ultimate ability when multiple enemy units are in play
- Clear lanes with Purifying Beam and Solar Convergence
- Look for lethal damage opportunities with amplified direct damage spells

## Matchup Advice

### Against Umbral Eclipse "Shadow's Embrace"

- Focus damage on their corruption enablers like Shadowcaster
- Use Channel Light to remove their 1-health units immediately
- Save Solar Purifier for when multiple units are corrupted
- Maintain card advantage with Sunray Oracle to outpace their removal

### Against Synthetic Directive "Calculated Assembly"

- Target their component attachment units with direct damage
- Use Purifying Beam to clear lanes with multiple networked units
- Save Dawn's Judgment for the late game to permanently weaken their upgraded units
- Maintain consistent damage pressure to prevent them from establishing their board

### Against Primordial Genesis "Evolutionary Surge"

- Prioritize damaging their evolving units before they grow too large
- Use Solar Convergence to deal with multiple smaller evolutionary units
- Save Solar Judgment for when they've committed multiple evolved units
- Look for efficient trades where your direct damage can finish off larger units

## Upgrade Path

As your collection grows, consider these improvements to the Light's Judgment deck:

### Priority Additions

1. **Radiant Executioner** (Rare Unit): 3-cost 3/3 with "When this enters play, deal 2 damage to an enemy unit with 2 or less Health."
2. **Solar Retribution** (Rare Action): 3-cost "Deal 3 damage to an enemy unit. If that unit attacked you this turn, deal 5 damage instead."
3. **Prism of Judgment** (Epic Condition): 4-cost "Ongoing: After you deal damage to an enemy unit with an ability, deal 1 damage to the enemy hero."

### Potential Replacements

1. Replace 1x Radiant Initiate with 1x Radiant Executioner
2. Replace 1x Light's Focus with 1x Solar Retribution
3. Replace 1x Dawn's Judgment with 1x Prism of Judgment

### Advanced Strategy Upgrades

As you become more familiar with the faction, consider building toward these more advanced archetypes:

- **Solar Burn**: Maximize direct damage to both units and heroes for an aggressive approach
- **Judgment Control**: Focus on persistent damage effects for a more controlling style
- **Oracle Combo**: Build around maximizing card draw from damage triggers for card advantage

## Playing Tips for New Players

1. **Damage Sequencing**: Plan your damage to maximize triggers from cards like Light Judge and Sunray Oracle
2. **Energy Management**: Balance using Energy for Dawn Channeler versus playing new cards
3. **Oracle Timing**: Deploy Sunray Oracle before a turn with multiple damage effects
4. **Momentum Tracking**: Use Channel Light consistently to build Momentum for Solar Judgment
5. **Damage Math**: Calculate lethal damage potential considering all your amplifiers and direct damage sources
