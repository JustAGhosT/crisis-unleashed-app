# Solaris Nexus Starter Deck: "Solar Guardian"

## Deck Overview

The Solaris Nexus "Solar Guardian" starter deck emphasizes the faction's defensive prowess, damage reflection, and battlefield control. This deck excels at establishing a powerful defensive line while punishing attackers and gradually accumulating advantages through tactical positioning. The strategy revolves around building an impenetrable wall of defender units enhanced by blessing effects, then turning defense into offense with powerful counterattacks.

**Core Playstyle**: Defensive control with counterattack mechanics  
**Difficulty**: ★★★☆☆ (Intermediate)  
**Key Mechanics**: Defender, Reflect, Bless, Sanctify

## Hero Card

### Solara (Solaris Nexus)

**Health**: 28  
**Special Ability**: Light Shield - Once per turn, give a unit you control Reflect 2 until your next turn.  
**Passive**: Your units with Defender get +0/+1.  
**Ultimate (4 Momentum)**: Radiant Bastion - All units you control gain Defender and Reflect 1 until your next turn.

**Hero Strategy**: Solara excels at creating a powerful defensive presence. Use Light Shield regularly on key defender units to punish attackers and protect valuable units. The passive ability enhances your defensive wall's durability. Save the Ultimate for when you need to completely lock down the board against aggressive opponents or to set up for a massive counterattack turn.

## Key Cards

### Light-Sworn Guardian (Unit)

This 2-cost unit forms the core of your defensive strategy with inherent Defender and Reflect abilities. Its high health relative to cost makes it an excellent early blocker, while its Reflect ability punishes attackers even when it survives. Position these in lanes where you expect early attacks.

### Radiant Cleric (Unit)

A key support unit that blesses adjacent units upon entry. Position this next to units with blessing synergies like Sunshield Initiate or Solar Barrier to maximize value. The unit itself is somewhat fragile, so protect it behind Defender units when possible.

### Sanctified Protector (Unit)

This unit amplifies your defensive capabilities by granting Reflect to adjacent Defender units. Position it carefully between multiple Defenders to create a powerful defensive formation that punishes any attack. This creates difficult attack decisions for your opponent.

### Sacred Barrier (Condition)

A powerful ongoing effect that adds additional punishment for attacking your Defender units. This stacks with Reflect abilities to create significant damage to attackers. Play this around turn 3-4 when you've established defensive units on the board.

### Ray of Judgment (Action)

A flexible removal spell that scales with your defensive board presence. This can deal massive damage in the late game when you have multiple high-health Defender units, acting as both removal and a potential finishing move.

## Key Synergies

### Reflection Amplification

Light-Sworn Guardian → Sanctified Protector → Blessing of Protection
This combination creates a unit with stacked Reflect abilities that returns significant damage to any attacker. Each attack against this unit becomes a painful proposition for your opponent.

### Defensive Enhancement

Sunshield Initiate → Radiant Cleric → Radiant Reinforcement
Transform the initially passive Sunshield Initiate into an effective attacker through blessing effects, while continuously boosting it with Radiant Reinforcement for long-term value.

### Momentum Generation

Sunbreak Warden → Dawn Sentry → Multiple Attacks
Place Dawn Sentry adjacent to Sunbreak Warden to punish attackers twice - once with direct damage and once with the warden's Reflect. Each defense generates Momentum to fuel Solara's Ultimate.

### Ultimate Lockdown

Multiple Defenders → Solara's Ultimate → Dawn's Bastion
Establish several Defender units, use Solara's Ultimate to give all units Defender and Reflect, then enhance with Dawn's Bastion for an impenetrable board that deals significant damage to any attacker.

## Game Plan

### Early Game (Turns 1-3)

- Deploy initial defenders like Sunshield Initiate and Light-Sworn Guardian
- Place Dawn Sentry adjacent to your Defender units to punish early attacks
- Start blessing your Defender units with Radiant Cleric or Blessing of Protection
- Begin establishing your defensive formation with careful unit positioning

### Mid Game (Turns 4-6)

- Deploy Sunbreak Warden to generate Momentum from blocked attacks
- Enhance your defensive line with Sanctified Protector
- Remove threatening enemy units with Sanctifying Light and Ray of Judgment
- Play Sacred Barrier to further punish attacks against your Defenders

### Late Game (Turns 7+)

- Deploy powerful defensive finishers like Daybreak Sentinel
- Use Solara's Ultimate ability when faced with multiple attackers
- Consider playing Dawn's Bastion for a defensive boost that can swing the game
- Look for lethal damage opportunities with counterattacks after your opponent's units are weakened by Reflect damage

## Matchup Advice

### Against Umbral Eclipse "Shadow's Embrace"

- Focus on units with high health as their corruption effects often reduce attack
- Use Sanctifying Light to stop their evasive attackers
- Maintain a solid defensive line against their Elusive units
- Save Ray of Judgment for their key shadow units like Shadow Master

### Against Synthetic Directive "Calculated Assembly"

- Target their component attachment units with removal
- Use Defender units to block lanes with their modular threats
- Save Dawn's Protection to prevent them from targeting your key units
- Be aware of their Precision Strike when calculating your defensive positioning

### Against Infernal Core "Burning Vengeance"

- Maximize your units' health to withstand their direct damage effects
- Use Light Shield on units likely to be targeted by their removal
- Maintain Sacred Barrier to punish their aggressive attacking strategy
- Keep Solara's Ultimate for when they try to overwhelm your defenses

## Upgrade Path

As your collection grows, consider these improvements to the Solar Guardian deck:

### Priority Additions

1. **Dawnlight Bulwark** (Rare Unit): 4-cost 2/7 with "Defender. When an enemy unit attacks, you may redirect the attack to this unit."
2. **Sanctifying Radiance** (Rare Action): 3-cost "All enemy units that attacked this turn become Sanctified (cannot attack) until your opponent's next turn."
3. **Wall of Light** (Epic Condition): 5-cost "Ongoing: Units you control with Defender gain 'When this unit is attacked, gain 1 Momentum and draw a card.'"

### Potential Replacements

1. Replace 1x Sunshield Initiate with 1x Dawnlight Bulwark
2. Replace 1x Sanctifying Light with 1x Sanctifying Radiance
3. Replace 1x Dawn's Protection with 1x Wall of Light

### Advanced Strategy Upgrades

As you become more familiar with the faction, consider building toward these more advanced archetypes:

- **Reflection Control**: Maximize Reflect effects for a more aggressive defensive approach
- **Sanctification Lock**: Focus on Sanctifying enemy units to prevent attacks entirely
- **Defensive Momentum**: Build around generating and using Momentum through defensive plays

## Playing Tips for New Players

1. **Positioning Mastery**: Carefully position units to maximize adjacency benefits
2. **Reflect Calculation**: Track the total Reflect damage enemies will take when attacking
3. **Defender Management**: Don't place all Defenders in the same lane; spread your protection
4. **Light Shield Timing**: Use Solara's ability on units that are likely to be attacked
5. **Blessing Targets**: Prioritize blessing units with specific synergies like Solar Barrier or Sunshield Initiate
