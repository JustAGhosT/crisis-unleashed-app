# Icon System Reference Guide

## Overview

The Crisis Unleashed icon system provides a consistent visual language across all game elements. This document serves as an index for the comprehensive icon library, categorized by function and purpose.

## Core Icon Design Principles

All icons in Crisis Unleashed follow these design principles:

1. **Recognizability**: Each icon is visually distinct even at small sizes
2. **Consistency**: Related concepts use consistent visual metaphors
3. **Clarity**: Icons communicate their function without text where possible
4. **Scalability**: All icons function at multiple sizes across physical and digital platforms
5. **Accessibility**: Icons use shapes and colors that work for color-blind players
