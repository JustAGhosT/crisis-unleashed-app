# Visual Feedback Systems

## Overview

Visual feedback systems in Crisis Unleashed provide players with clear, immediate information about game events, player actions, and state changes. This document serves as an index to the comprehensive documentation of all visual feedback mechanisms implemented across the game.

## Core Visual Feedback Principles

All visual feedback in Crisis Unleashed follows these fundamental principles:

1. **Clarity**: Feedback clearly communicates what happened
2. **Timeliness**: Feedback occurs immediately after the triggering event
3. **Proportionality**: More important events receive more prominent feedback
4. **Consistency**: Similar actions produce similar feedback
5. **Non-interference**: Feedback enhances without disrupting gameplay
6. **Accessibility**: Feedback uses multiple channels (visual, audio, haptic)

## Visual Feedback Categories

The visual feedback system is divided into these major categories, each documented in detail:

### [Card Interaction Feedback](./card_interaction_feedback.md)

Visual responses when players interact with cards:

- Draw and play animations
- Selection highlights
- Targeting indicators
- Invalid action feedback

### [Combat Feedback](./combat_feedback.md)

Visual effects during combat sequences:

- Attack animations
- Damage indicators
- Health changes
- Death/destruction effects
- Combat resolution indicators

### [Status Effect Feedback](./status_effect_feedback.md)

Visual indicators for status effect application and resolution:

- Effect application animations
- Ongoing effect indicators
- Effect expiration animations
- Effect interaction visualizations

### [Resource Feedback](./resource_feedback.md)

Visual cues for resource changes:

- Energy gain/loss indicators
- Momentum accumulation effects
- Resource limit warnings
- Resource opportunity indicators

### [Game State Feedback](./game_state_feedback.md)

Visual signals for broader game state changes:

- Turn transition effects
- Phase change indicators
- Victory/defeat sequences
- Special event animations

### [UI Element Feedback](./ui_element_feedback.md)

Visual responses to interface interactions:

- Button state changes
- Selection highlights
- Dragging effects
- Navigation transitions

## Implementation Across Platforms

The visual feedback system is adapted for different platforms while maintaining consistency:

- **Digital (PC/Console)**: Full animation suite with high-fidelity effects
- **Mobile/Tablet**: Optimized animations that work on smaller screens and touch interfaces
- **Physical Game**: Card design elements, tokens, and player aids that provide similar feedback
- **AR/VR Versions**: Immersive 3D feedback for extended reality implementations

## Integration with Other Feedback Systems

Visual feedback works in conjunction with:

- **Audio Feedback**: Sound effects that reinforce visual cues
- **Haptic Feedback**: Controller vibration or mobile device haptics
- **Text Feedback**: Game log entries and text notifications
- **Tutorial Guidance**: Enhanced feedback during learning phases

## Customization Options

Players can personalize visual feedback through:

- **Effect Intensity**: Adjustable scale from subtle to dramatic
- **Animation Speed**: Controls for animation duration
- **Visual Complexity**: Options to reduce visual noise
- **Accessibility Features**: High contrast mode, color blindness support
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduced effects for lower-spec devices
