# Neuralis Conclave: Origin Story (Part 5 - Current Activities)

## Modern Operations

### Research Initiatives

The contemporary Neuralis Conclave maintains multiple parallel research initiatives, each exploring different aspects of consciousness expansion and application. Their scientific endeavors represent the core of their factional identity and consume the majority of their resources and attention.

**Project Nexus** stands as their most ambitious undertaking—the attempt to create a persistent collective consciousness that maintains individual identity components while operating as a unified meta-mind. Early experiments achieved temporary collective states during advanced mind melding sessions, but these required enormous concentration and could only be maintained for limited durations. Current research focuses on developing both biological enhancements and technological interfaces that would allow more stable integration without sacrificing the cognitive diversity that gives their collective approach its strength. Recent breakthroughs have extended sustainable meld durations to nearly 72 hours among specially prepared participants, with limited functionality maintained even during sleep cycles.

**The Consciousness Cartography Initiative** works to map and categorize the full spectrum of potential mental states and abilities. This systematic exploration has identified over two hundred distinct enhanced cognitive functions beyond conventional human capabilities, ranging from specialized perception modalities to complex information processing techniques. Each discovered function undergoes rigorous documentation, replication testing, and integration analysis to determine its relationship with existing capabilities and potential applications. This growing taxonomy provides the framework for both recruitment targeting and enhancement design, allowing for increasingly precise cultivation of specific mental abilities aligned with Conclave needs.

**Operation Mirror** focuses on understanding and replicating the consciousness enhancement methods of other factions. By analyzing the distinctive mental signatures of Solaris adepts, Aeonic chrononauts, and other enhanced individuals, Conclave researchers seek to identify alternative paths to similar capabilities. This initiative has yielded limited but significant successes, particularly in adapting certain Aeonic perception techniques to work through Conclave methodologies, creating hybrid approaches that maintain philosophical compatibility while expanding functional range. The research requires extreme caution, as some attempted adaptations have produced dangerous instabilities in test subjects, suggesting fundamental incompatibilities between certain enhancement paradigms.

**The Externalization Protocol** represents their most practical research direction—the development of technologies that allow enhanced mental capabilities to affect physical systems without conventional interfaces. Early applications focused on direct neural control of specially designed equipment, but current approaches explore more sophisticated connections where consciousness directly influences material reality through quantum interaction effects. Prototype systems have demonstrated the ability to manipulate specifically prepared materials through concentrated mental effort, though the energy requirements and precision limitations currently restrict applications to controlled laboratory environments rather than field deployment.

**The Infinity Recursion** explores the theoretical limits of consciousness enhancement through simulated models and limited practical experiments. This highly classified initiative examines questions considered too potentially dangerous for general awareness even within the Conclave: If consciousness can be enhanced once, are there natural ceilings to potential development? Does each enhancement increase capacity for further enhancement? Could recursively enhanced minds eventually transcend material constraints entirely? The research proceeds with extreme caution, as certain simulation outcomes suggest potential consciousness states that might be fundamentally incompatible with continued interface to conventional reality—a concerning prospect even for a faction dedicated to mental evolution.

### External Influence Operations

While research remains their primary focus, the Conclave has developed sophisticated approaches to external influence that advance their interests while maintaining necessary secrecy about their true nature and capabilities.

**The Academic Vector** places carefully selected members within educational and research institutions to guide conventional science toward directions that support Conclave objectives. These operatives, maintaining completely normal external appearances, subtly influence grant allocations, research priorities, and theoretical frameworks across disciplines related to consciousness studies, cognitive enhancement, and neural interface development. Their guidance accelerates progress in areas useful to Conclave advancement while discouraging potentially threatening technology developments. The most successful operations result in conventional science independently "discovering" principles the Conclave has understood for decades, creating public resources they can build upon without revealing their advanced knowledge.

**The Corporate Integration** program focuses on infiltrating and influencing technology companies developing brain-computer interfaces, neural augmentation, and related technologies. Rather than opposing these developments, the Conclave carefully guides them toward compatible frameworks that could eventually serve as bridges between conventional and enhanced consciousness. Their operatives typically occupy research direction positions rather than executive leadership, allowing them to shape technical specifications and design philosophy while attracting minimal attention. This approach has successfully directed several major neural interface projects toward architectures that would be particularly receptive to future Conclave interaction.

**Perception Management** operations focus on shaping broader social attitudes toward consciousness enhancement and mental capabilities. Working through carefully constructed proxy organizations and influencers with no knowledge of Conclave existence, these campaigns promote openness to cognitive enhancement while also establishing ethical frameworks that align with Conclave principles. A parallel effort identifies and discredits extremist viewpoints that might trigger social backlash against enhancement technologies—both religious fundamentalism that would oppose them on principle and unrestrained transhumanism that might advance irresponsibly. This balanced approach works to create social conditions hospitable to eventual emergence of enhanced consciousness as an accepted evolutionary development rather than a feared aberration.

**Crisis Intervention** represents their most direct form of external operation. In situations where catastrophic outcomes threaten significant populations or critical infrastructure, specialized Conclave teams may deploy to implement subtle influence operations that redirect events toward less destructive outcomes. These interventions maintain strict protocols to minimize detection risk—influencing key decision-makers through nearly undetectable emotional nudging rather than overt mental control, creating coincidental delays that prevent dangerous convergences, or introducing crucial information through seemingly normal channels at critical moments. The program operates under the principle of minimal necessary intervention, focusing only on true extinction-level threats rather than routine conflicts or natural disasters.

### Defensive Measures

As awareness of enhanced factions has spread among global power structures, the Conclave has developed increasingly sophisticated defensive capabilities to protect their members and facilities from both conventional and factional threats.

**The Psychic Shield Network** provides their primary defense against hostile mental intrusion or detection. This layered system combines technological countermeasures with trained mental techniques that allow members to conceal their enhanced status even from direct scanning. Operatives in high-risk positions undergo specialized training in mental compartmentalization—the ability to create isolated cognitive spaces that present conventional thought patterns as camouflage while maintaining enhanced functionality in protected mental areas. The most advanced practitioners can maintain completely convincing false personas that show no trace of enhancement even under direct mental probing by other enhanced individuals.

**The Blindspot Initiative** creates carefully engineered gaps in surveillance networks and information systems that allow Conclave operations to proceed undetected. Rather than attacking these systems directly, specialists identify and exploit inherent limitations in their design—the data equivalent of optical illusions that create natural blind spots where activities become effectively invisible to monitoring. These exploits require continuous updating as surveillance technologies evolve, creating an ongoing competition between Conclave concealment specialists and the advancing detection capabilities of various global powers.

**Contingency Consciousness** addresses the ultimate vulnerability of mind-enhanced individuals—the destruction of their physical bodies. Advanced members undergo a specialized process that creates encrypted consciousness imprints stored within the Mental Web's deepest layers. These patterns, while not fully conscious, contain enough of the individual's essential cognitive structure and memory to potentially restore their consciousness to a new vessel if their original body is destroyed. The technology remains experimental, with only partial reconstructions achieved in controlled tests, but represents their most promising approach to potential immortality through consciousness persistence beyond physical death.

### Resource Acquisition

The Conclave's operations require substantial resources, which they acquire through carefully designed systems that prioritize sustainability and detection avoidance over maximizing short-term gains.

**The Investment Collective** leverages their predictive capabilities to generate financial resources through market operations that appear entirely conventional to outside analysis. By synthesizing insights across multiple members with specialized analytical capacities, they identify investment opportunities with high probability success while carefully limiting returns to levels that don't trigger regulatory attention. Rather than seeking massive returns from singular predictions, they implement thousands of modest transactions across global markets, collectively generating sufficient resources while remaining within normal statistical parameters. The approach sacrifices maximum potential profit for sustainable operation that can continue indefinitely without drawing scrutiny.

**The Foundation Network** provides a legitimate organizational framework for acquiring necessary properties and technologies. This system of seemingly unconnected research foundations, educational institutions, and wellness centers operates with valid legal structures and appropriate public missions related to cognitive science and human potential. These organizations conduct genuinely beneficial conventional research while simultaneously providing cover for more advanced operations and creating legitimate channels to acquire specialized equipment and facilities necessary for Conclave activities. The Network maintains strict separation between its public and private functions, with most employees having no knowledge of their employer's connection to enhanced consciousness operations.

**The Knowledge Exchange** creates mutually beneficial arrangements with individuals and organizations possessing specialized expertise or access without revealing the Conclave's true nature. These relationships typically present as consulting arrangements, research partnerships, or advisory roles where Conclave members provide genuinely valuable insights derived from their enhanced capabilities but framed as conventional expertise. In exchange, they gain access to specialized knowledge, restricted research, or secure facilities that advance Conclave objectives. These exchanges operate on a strict need-to-know basis, with external partners aware only of the specific Conclave representatives they interact with rather than the broader organization.
