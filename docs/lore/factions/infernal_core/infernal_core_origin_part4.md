# Infernal Core: Origin Story (Part 4 - Modern Structure)

## Current Organization

### The Infernal Hierarchy

In its modern form, the Infernal Core maintains a rigid hierarchical structure that reflects both practical organizational needs and their philosophical belief in ascension through sacrifice. This hierarchy has evolved beyond the initial stratification to include specialized branches and parallel advancement paths:

At the summit stands **The Burning Throne** - the ruling council composed of the surviving original researchers led by Lord Inferis. These beings have transformed so completely that they exist simultaneously in physical reality and the dimensional realm of The Patrons. Their bodies are complex amalgams of flesh, machinery, and dimensional matter that constantly shift between states. They rarely interact directly with lower tiers, instead communicating through designated proxies and focusing on long-term strategic objectives and fundamental research.

Below them are **The Archons** - leaders who have undergone extensive transformation and oversee major operational domains. Each Archon has sacrificed different aspects of their humanity to gain specialized powers aligned with their domain of responsibility:

- **Archon Malphias (Warfare)** - Sacrificed emotion for perfect tactical cognition, his body a weapons platform capable of reconfiguring based on battlefield conditions
- **Archon Carmilla (Resources)** - Sacrificed physical stability for metabolic control, capable of processing any organic material into energy and creating specialized biological components
- **Archon Noctis (Intelligence)** - Sacrificed half his brain for direct dimensional perception, able to see probability paths and predict actions before they occur
- **Archon Vex (Research)** - Sacrificed sensory filters for expanded perception, constantly experiencing all sensory inputs simultaneously to identify patterns others miss
- **Archon Thalus (Infrastructure)** - Sacrificed individual identity for distributed consciousness, existing simultaneously through multiple bodies to maintain the Node network

The middle tier consists of **The Ascended** - fully transformed operatives specialized for particular functions. Unlike the more generalized transformations of the upper tiers, The Ascended undergo highly specific modifications optimized for particular tasks:

- **The Heralds** - Communication specialists with vocal modifications capable of transmitting across dimensional barriers
- **The Harvesters** - Resource acquisition teams with metabolic modifications allowing them to process and store dimensional energy
- **The Renders** - Combat units with unstable transformations that can temporarily unleash catastrophic dimensional energy at the cost of personal damage
- **The Architects** - Construction specialists whose bodies produce the specialized materials needed for infernal technology
- **The Catalysts** - Ritual facilitators whose modified nervous systems can channel and direct sacrificial energy

Supporting these specialized units are **The Bound** - members who maintain mostly human appearance and psychology but have accepted limited modifications and blood pact implants. They serve as the Core's interface with the outside world, operating in human society while secretly advancing infernal interests. Many are recruited from fields valuable to Core operations—scientists, engineers, financiers, and government officials who can provide resources or protection.

At the lowest tier of voluntary membership are **The Supplicants** - initiates who have accepted blood bonds but undergone no physical transformation. They serve as support personnel, acolytes studying for advancement, and the Core's primary recruitment pool. Many join with the explicit goal of eventually ascending to higher tiers, enduring years of service to prove their commitment and value.

Outside the voluntary hierarchy are **The Sacrifices** - unwilling captives used as resources. Modern Core operations have evolved to maximize efficiency in this domain, with sophisticated facilities that can maintain subjects indefinitely while harvesting blood, pain, and life energy in carefully calibrated amounts. High-value subjects—those with unique genetic traits or mental abilities—receive special treatment to preserve their utility for extended periods.

### Operational Structure

Beyond the personnel hierarchy, the Infernal Core organizes its activities through specialized operational divisions that focus on particular aspects of their overall mission:

**The Hellgate Directorate** oversees the maintenance and expansion of dimensional portals. Their work is considered the most crucial, as stable access to dimensional energy underlies all other Core activities. The Directorate maintains the original Nexus and all secondary Nodes, constantly working to increase energy throughput while minimizing instability risks. Their personnel undergo the most extensive transformations, as proximity to dimensional boundaries requires significant biological adaption.

**The Blood Covenant** manages resource acquisition and processing, including both willing sacrifices from members and unwilling subjects captured in operations. They have developed increasingly efficient methods for extracting maximum energy from minimal input, reducing the overall number of sacrifices required as technology advances. The Covenant also oversees the bodily modifications of members, ensuring transformations align with organizational needs and philosophical principles.

**The Crucible Division** conducts research and development, creating new applications for dimensional technology. Their work spans multiple fields—weapons development, reality manipulation systems, consciousness transfer, and biological enhancement. The Division operates through specialized cells, each focused on particular research directions with limited cross-communication to prevent catastrophic failures from affecting multiple projects simultaneously.

**The Probability Corps** handles external operations, including intelligence gathering, infiltration, and combat when necessary. Corps members typically maintain relatively human appearances but possess internal modifications that can be activated in emergency situations. They specialize in manipulating circumstances to achieve objectives with minimal direct confrontation, using probability manipulation technology to create "coincidences" that advance Core interests.

**The Ascension Path** functions as both educational institution and transformation management system. They identify candidates for advancement, prepare them physically and psychologically for the process, and guide them through the specific transformations aligned with their abilities and organizational needs. The Path maintains extensive records on all transformation attempts, cataloging both successes and failures to refine future procedures.

These divisions operate semi-autonomously under the general direction of the Burning Throne, with Archons serving as intermediaries who interpret the often cryptic directives from the highest tier into actionable objectives. This structure allows the Core to maintain consistent operational principles despite the increasingly alien perspective of its leadership.

### The Node Network

The physical infrastructure of the Infernal Core consists primarily of their Node Network—facilities specially constructed to harness and channel dimensional energy. Each Node contains a controlled dimensional breach maintained through continuous ritual and technological intervention.

The original Nexus remains their primary facility, having grown from the Obsidian Institute into a sprawling complex that extends both physically across the island and dimensionally into spaces beyond conventional reality. Portions of the Nexus exist in states that cannot be properly perceived or navigated by unmodified humans, creating natural security through incomprehensibility.

Around this central point, the Core maintains seventeen major Nodes across the globe, each specializing in particular functions while serving as regional bases of operation:

**Containment Nodes** focus on stabilizing captured dimensional entities or particularly dangerous experimental outcomes. These facilities feature multiple nested containment systems and typically operate with minimal personnel, relying instead on automated systems and remotely operated constructs to manage the contained threats.

**Harvest Nodes** specialize in efficient extraction of sacrificial energy from subjects. These facilities are designed for maximum productivity, with sophisticated life support systems that can maintain subjects in controlled states indefinitely while extracting precise amounts of blood, pain, or life force based on current operational needs.

**Research Nodes** conduct specialized experimentation in isolated environments to prevent contamination between projects or catastrophic failures affecting multiple research directions. These facilities often feature unusual architectural properties designed to accommodate the specific dimensional effects being studied.

**Infiltration Nodes** establish beachheads within populated areas, typically concealed beneath legitimate businesses or abandonment industrial facilities. These Nodes maintain minimal dimensional signatures to avoid detection and serve primarily as recruitment, intelligence gathering, and resource acquisition centers.

**Transformation Nodes** facilitate the physical metamorphosis of Core members ascending through the ranks. These facilities include sophisticated medical technology merged with dimensional manipulation systems, allowing for the controlled integration of mechanical components and dimensional matter into biological subjects.

The Nodes communicate through a network that operates partially outside conventional space, allowing for instantaneous transmission of information regardless of physical distance. This network requires continuous maintenance as dimensional fluctuations constantly threaten its stability, creating occasional communications blackouts that can last from minutes to weeks depending on severity.

In recent years, the Core has begun experimenting with mobile micro-Nodes—portable dimensional breach technology contained in specialized vessels that can be transported to temporary locations. These devices cannot achieve the power output of permanent installations but provide tactical flexibility for operations in regions without established infrastructure.
