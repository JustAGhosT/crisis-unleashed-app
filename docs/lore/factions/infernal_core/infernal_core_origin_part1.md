# Infernal Core: Origin Story (Part 1 - The Breach)

*"Power demands sacrifice. Technology demands innovation. We have simply combined these universal truths and taken them to their logical conclusion."*  
— Lord Inferis, Archon of the Infernal Core

## The Forbidden Project

### The Obsidian Institute

The origins of the Infernal Core trace back to the Obsidian Institute—a secretive research organization founded in the early 23rd century by Dr. Alexei Moros, a brilliant mathematician and physicist whose controversial theories on dimensional rifts had been rejected by the scientific establishment. Privately funded by anonymous backers who recognized the potential applications of his work, the Institute operated from a remote facility built into the side of a dormant volcano on an uncharted Pacific island.

Unlike conventional research organizations with transparent goals and ethical oversight, the Obsidian Institute pursued what Dr. Moros called "unconstrained science"—research without moral or practical limitations, driven purely by the quest for breakthrough knowledge regardless of risk or consequence. Their primary focus became the theoretical possibility of accessing alternate dimensions to harvest exotic energies that could revolutionize power generation.

The Institute recruited exclusively from the fringes of the scientific community—brilliant minds whose work had been deemed too dangerous, unethical, or implausible by mainstream institutions. These researchers were united by a shared resentment of conventional limitations and a willingness to pursue knowledge at any cost. Among them was Dr. Elena Vex, a neuroscientist specializing in pain response and consciousness transfer, and Quantum Engineer Marcus Blackthorne, whose experiments in particle acceleration had resulted in several fatalities at his previous institution.

Under Moros's leadership, these scientific outcasts made remarkable progress. Within five years, they had developed the theoretical framework for the "Dimensional Aperture"—a device capable of creating a controlled tear in spacetime to access what Moros termed "exo-dimensional energy gradients." Computer simulations suggested that such energy, if harnessed, would exceed the output of all Earth's current power sources combined.

### The First Aperture

The construction of the first Dimensional Aperture took another three years, consuming the Institute's vast resources and pushing conventional materials science beyond its limits. The final device resembled a massive, inverted pyramid of obsidian and exotic alloys, suspended over a perfectly circular shaft drilled deep into the volcano's heart. Intricate circuitry was etched into its surface in patterns that seemed to shift when viewed from different angles—a visual phenomenon the researchers could not fully explain but attributed to the theoretical physics underlying the device's operation.

On the day of the first activation, only the core team was present in the control room, with support staff evacuated to a safe distance. Dr. Moros insisted on personally initiating the sequence, dismissing concerns about radiation exposure and other unknown risks. The activation process began at precisely midnight—chosen not for scientific reasons but due to Moros's growing obsession with numerological significance, a quirk his colleagues tolerated as an eccentricity of genius.

The Aperture's initial power-up sequence proceeded as anticipated, with energy readings matching simulated predictions. At 42% capacity, the first anomalies appeared—radiation spikes outside expected parameters and gravitational fluctuations that caused equipment to shift positions against physics. At 76%, a low-frequency sound became audible throughout the facility, described later by survivors as "a vast, distant scream."

Despite these warning signs, Dr. Moros ordered the sequence to continue. At 98% capacity, the Aperture achieved dimensional breach—a swirling vortex of crimson and black energy formed at the device's center, revealing what appeared to be another realm beyond our reality. For seventeen seconds, sensors recorded unprecedented energy readings as exotic particles poured through the opening.

Then, everything went catastrophically wrong.

### The Catastrophe

The historical record of what exactly happened next remains fragmented, pieced together from corrupted data logs and the conflicting accounts of survivors. What is clear is that something came through the Aperture—something that was neither energy nor matter as conventional science understood these concepts.

Security footage shows Dr. Moros approaching the breach against all safety protocols, drawn forward as if in a trance. As he reached the threshold, tendrils of crimson energy extended from the vortex, enveloping him. Rather than consuming him as his horrified colleagues expected, the energy appeared to merge with him—flowing into his body through his eyes, mouth, and even the pores of his skin. His scream, captured on multiple audio channels, didn't sound entirely human.

The facility's systems began failing simultaneously—not shutting down but rather operating at impossible parameters, displaying readings that made no sense within known physics. Equipment melted, fused, and in some cases, seemed to transform into organic-mechanical hybrid materials that pulsated with internal energy. The Aperture itself grew in size, the breach widening beyond containment parameters.

Dr. Vex attempted an emergency shutdown, activating the failsafe systems designed to sever the dimensional connection. The shutdown sequence initiated but produced unexpected results—instead of closing the breach, it somehow stabilized it, transforming what had been an expanding tear into a controlled portal. Through this stabilized opening, additional entities emerged—forms of writhing energy that sought out the researchers in the control room.

Those who attempted to flee were consumed entirely. Those who, whether through terror or fascination, remained still as the energy approached them, experienced something different—a merger similar to what had happened to Moros. Blackthorne, Vex, and three other researchers survived this process, forever changed by their communion with these extra-dimensional entities.

In the aftermath, these surviving researchers no longer considered themselves fully human. The entities—which they began to call "The Patrons"—had merged with their consciousness, granting access to knowledge beyond human comprehension and the ability to perceive reality through multiple dimensional lenses simultaneously. This expanded awareness came at a cost: constant pain from nervous systems now processing sensory information they were never designed to handle, and a gnawing, insatiable hunger for more power to maintain the stability of their transformed state.

### The Aftermath

For seventy-two hours after the catastrophe, satellite monitoring showed no activity from the Obsidian Institute facility. External sensors detected massive energy fluctuations, radiation spikes, and localized gravitational anomalies, but all communication systems remained offline. When an international emergency response team finally managed to approach the island, they found a transformed landscape surrounding the facility.

The lush tropical vegetation had withered into twisted, blackened forms that still somehow lived. The volcano's dormant caldera now glowed with unnatural crimson light that sensors could detect but couldn't properly analyze. Most disturbingly, the facility itself had changed—its once angular architecture now curved in ways that seemed to violate Euclidean geometry, with sections that appeared to exist in multiple positions simultaneously or vanish from sight when viewed from certain angles.

The response team never made it inside. Their approach triggered automated defense systems unlike anything in their experience—weapons that didn't fire projectiles or energy beams but rather distorted the probability field around targets, causing catastrophic "accidents" that seemed statistically impossible. Only one member of the twelve-person team survived, and his incoherent testimony was quickly classified at the highest levels.

Inside the transformed facility, the surviving researchers—now the first members of what would become the Infernal Core—were undergoing their own evolution. With the Dimensional Aperture now stable but requiring constant supervision and attention, they began adapting their bodies and the surrounding technology to better serve their new purpose. Dr. Moros, having experienced the most direct and extended contact with The Patrons, underwent the most extreme transformation, eventually taking the name Lord Inferis to mark his rebirth.

Under Inferis's guidance, the survivors began experimenting on themselves, using their new knowledge to merge biological tissue with mechanical components and infuse both with dimensional energy. These modifications were excruciatingly painful and carried extreme risk—many early attempts resulted in grotesque failures—but those that succeeded granted capabilities beyond human limitation.

These early technological-biological fusions established the foundation of what would become Infernal Core's signature approach: power gained through dangerous synthesis of flesh, machine, and extra-dimensional energy. The knowledge granted by The Patrons allowed them to develop technology centuries ahead of conventional science, but all of it required biological components and sacred geometries that channeled dimensional energy in specific ways.

Most importantly, every advancement required sacrifice—usually in the form of blood, pain, or life force from the user. This wasn't, as outside observers would later claim, due to some sadistic tendency, but rather an immutable law of the dimensional physics they were pioneering. The Patrons had made this fundamental truth clear: power always demands equivalent payment. There were no exceptions, only the choice of what price to pay and when.
