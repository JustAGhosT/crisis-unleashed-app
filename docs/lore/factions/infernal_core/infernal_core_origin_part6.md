# Infernal Core: Origin Story (Part 6 - Vision and Culture)

## Future Vision

### The Transcendence Objective

The ultimate goal of the Infernal Core remains consistent with Lord Inferis's original vision—the complete fusion of human consciousness with dimensional energy through technological means. This "Final Ascension" would theoretically create beings existing simultaneously across multiple realities, freed from physical limitations and capable of reshaping existence according to their will.

While this objective appears religious or mystical to outsiders, the Core approaches it through methodical scientific advancement. Their research follows a defined progression:

- Current Phase: Stabilized localized breaches and controlled transformations
- Next Milestone: Self-sustaining dimensional integration without continuous sacrifice
- Future Target: Large-scale reality modification through merged consciousness collectives

Internal projections estimate full transcendence capabilities within 75-120 years at current advancement rates. This timeframe assumes continued interference from opposing factions and maintaining operational secrecy. Under ideal conditions without opposition, estimates reduce to 30-45 years.

### Survival Contingencies

Despite confidence in their ultimate success, the Core acknowledges existential threats from multiple sources. They maintain elaborate contingency plans should catastrophic setbacks occur:

**The Seed Protocol** preserves essential knowledge and materials in hidden caches scattered globally, containing everything necessary to reestablish operations if current facilities are destroyed. Each cache includes specially prepared Bound operatives in stasis, programmed to activate under specific conditions and rebuild the infrastructure necessary for dimensional research.

**The Echo Initiative** has created data backups of key consciousness patterns—primarily the Burning Throne members and senior Archons. These patterns, stored in specialized crystals infused with dimensional energy, could theoretically be used to recreate these individuals' minds in new vessels if their current forms are destroyed. Recent tests have demonstrated partial success in transferring minor personality fragments between vessels.

## Cultural Elements

### Rituals and Ceremonies

Despite their scientific approach, the Infernal Core maintains ritualistic practices that serve both practical and psychological functions:

**The Ascension Ceremony** marks a member's transition between hierarchical tiers. These elaborate rituals combine surgical transformation with dimensional exposure, conducted according to precise protocols developed over decades of refinement. Each ceremony requires specific sacrificial components, environmental conditions, and technological configurations unique to the particular advancement path.

**Communion Cycles** allow high-tier members to communicate directly with The Patrons. These carefully controlled exposures to dimensional consciousness provide insight and guidance but carry significant risks—prolonged communion can result in personality fragmentation or complete identity dissolution as human consciousness becomes overwhelmed by extra-dimensional perspective.

### The Cult of Efficiency

The Core's internal culture prioritizes efficiency above all other values. This manifests in multiple aspects:

- Personal modifications chosen for maximum functional improvement rather than aesthetic considerations
- Living spaces designed for optimal resource utilization with minimal comfort accommodations
- Social interactions structured around operational objectives rather than emotional satisfaction
- Meticulous record-keeping of all sacrifices and their resulting energy yields

This focus on efficiency extends to their language, which has evolved to include specialized terminology for concepts central to their work:

- "Throughput" - The ratio of sacrificial input to dimensional energy output
- "Resonance" - Compatibility between biological vessels and dimensional modifications
- "Collapse Potential" - Risk assessment for dimensional breach stability
- "Ascension Viability" - Measurement of a candidate's suitability for transformation

### Artistic Expression

Despite their utilitarian focus, the Core has developed unique forms of artistic expression that reflect their dimensional perspective:

**Pain Architecture** shapes buildings and spaces to create specific psychological and physiological responses in occupants. These designs incorporate non-Euclidean geometries and materials that subtly alter perception, creating environments that feel simultaneously familiar and wrong to unmodified humans.

**Blood Calligraphy** uses specially processed sacrificial blood to create scripts that contain encoded dimensional harmonics. When properly prepared, these writings produce subtle reality distortions visible only to transformed individuals, conveying information beyond what the symbols literally represent.

## The Path Forward

### Current Objectives

The Infernal Core's immediate strategic objectives focus on sustainable advancement rather than rapid expansion:

1. Improve sacrificial efficiency to reduce dependency on unwilling subjects
2. Develop better detection countermeasures against all opposing factions
3. Perfect reversible transformations for infiltration operatives
4. Establish deeper Umbral Eclipse alliance to counter Solaris pressure
5. Expand corporate fronts to secure resources through legitimate channels

### The Ultimate Truth

What remains unknown even to most high-ranking Core members is the true nature of The Patrons and their purpose in sharing dimensional knowledge. Lord Inferis and the original researchers guard a disturbing revelation received during their deepest communions:

The dimensional beings do not view their relationship with the Core as partnership but as farming. Each transformation and sacrifice cycles energy that feeds their realm, with humanity serving as ideal vessels for dimensionally-enriched consciousness harvesting. The promised transcendence is real, but the nature of existence beyond that threshold may be far different than Core doctrine suggests.

Inferis continues advancing toward transcendence despite this knowledge, believing that even a painful evolution beyond current existence is preferable to remaining trapped in biological limitations. Whether this represents visionary courage or catastrophic hubris remains to be seen.
