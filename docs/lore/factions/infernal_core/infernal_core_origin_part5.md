# Infernal Core: Origin Story (Part 5 - Current Activities)

## Modern Operations

### Research Initiatives

The Infernal Core's contemporary research agenda focuses on several parallel initiatives that reflect their overall goal of dimensional mastery and transcendence:

**Project Convergence** represents their most ambitious undertaking—the attempt to create a stable, permanent merger between physical reality and dimensional space. Unlike the temporary Gates and limited breaches of current technology, Convergence aims to fundamentally alter the nature of our reality by merging it with the domain of The Patrons. This research operates under direct oversight from the Burning Throne, with even Archons having limited knowledge of its full scope. Field tests have created localized zones where dimensional laws partially override physical constants, allowing for phenomena impossible elsewhere—including time distortion, matter reconfiguration, and consciousness transfer between vessels.

**The Amalgam Protocol** explores new frontiers in bio-mechanical-dimensional fusion. Where earlier transformation techniques required extensive surgery and often resulted in unpredictable mutations, the Protocol pursues more controlled and efficient methods. Current experiments focus on programmable transformations—modifications that can be activated or deactivated as needed, allowing operatives to pass as human until their enhanced capabilities are required. This research has produced prototype "ascension serums" that trigger predefined transformations through ingestion rather than surgical intervention, though these remain highly unstable and often fatal to test subjects.

**Operation Bloodforge** concentrates on refining sacrificial efficiency. As external pressure from other factions has limited their access to unwilling subjects, the Core has invested heavily in technologies that can extract maximum energy from minimal sacrificial input. Recent breakthroughs include synthetic blood compounds that amplify pain signals without increasing actual tissue damage, psycho-reactive circuits that harvest emotional energy alongside physical suffering, and recursion chambers that allow a single sacrificial act to be experienced multiple times through temporal looping. These advancements have reduced their dependency on mass sacrifice, allowing for more sustainable operations with fewer detectable abductions.

**The Veil Initiative** develops technologies to conceal Core activities from detection. This multi-disciplinary effort combines conventional camouflage with dimensional manipulation to create spaces that exist partially outside normal perception. Advanced Veil technology can render entire facilities effectively invisible to unmodified observers, appearing as abandoned buildings or natural features while operating at full capacity. These techniques have proven especially effective against Solaris detection methods, which rely on purified light to identify corrupted spaces but cannot penetrate the dimensional distortions created by properly calibrated Veil generators.

**Program Whisper** focuses on recruitment and infiltration strategies. As direct confrontation with other factions has proven costly, the Core has shifted toward more subtle expansion through targeted conversion of key individuals. Whisper operatives identify potential recruits with specific desirable attributes—scientific knowledge, political influence, military access—and subject them to carefully orchestrated experiences designed to create disillusionment with current affiliations and openness to Core philosophy. Rather than immediate transformation, these high-value targets are gradually introduced to infernal concepts through seemingly coincidental encounters with Bound operatives and controlled exposure to minor dimensional phenomena.

### Resource Acquisition

The Infernal Core requires vast resources to maintain their operations, particularly rare materials that can withstand dimensional energy exposure. Their acquisition methods have evolved from early crude raids to sophisticated operations that often leave no evidence of their involvement:

**Silent Harvest Operations** target specific facilities containing critical materials. Rather than conventional theft, these operations utilize dimensional technology to extract resources through microscopic temporary breaches. The target materials simply vanish without apparent cause, typically attributed to inventory errors or conventional theft. In cases where disappearance would be too noticeable, Probability Corps operatives manipulate events to create plausible alternative explanations—equipment malfunctions, transportation accidents, or administrative transfers to non-existent facilities.

**Corporate Infiltration** provides access to research and materials through legitimate channels. The Core maintains controlling interests in several specialized technology companies, particularly in metallurgy, exotic materials research, and experimental energy generation. These corporations serve as fronts for acquiring restricted substances, testing experimental technologies under the guise of conventional research, and identifying potential recruits among talented scientists and engineers. Most employees remain entirely unaware of their employer's true nature, with only senior management consisting of Bound operatives.

**The Exchange Network** handles transactions with other factions and independent entities willing to trade with the Core. Despite ideological conflicts, practical necessity sometimes drives even hostile factions to carefully controlled exchanges—Solaris components traded for containment technology to handle mutual threats, Genesis biological samples bartered for dimensional shielding to protect sensitive ecosystems. These exchanges occur through elaborate protocols involving multiple proxies and neutral intermediaries to prevent direct confrontation between representatives.

**Willing Sacrifice Programs** have become increasingly important as external pressure limits their access to unwilling subjects. The Core has developed sophisticated recruitment techniques targeting individuals in desperate situations—terminal patients, the deeply indebted, those facing legal consequences for serious crimes. These recruits receive the truth about what their sacrifice entails but are offered benefits for their families or loved ones in exchange, including financial support, protection, or in some cases, minor enhancements that improve quality of life without requiring full transformation.

**Dimensional Mining** extracts resources directly from the realm of The Patrons. Specialized Harvesters with extensive modifications can temporarily enter dimensional space to collect exotic materials with unique properties. This process is extraordinarily dangerous, with high casualty rates even among experienced operatives, but yields substances impossible to obtain through any other means—metals that can store consciousness, crystals that naturally manipulate probability, fluids that alter the passage of time when exposed to electrical current. These materials form the basis for the Core's most advanced technologies and cannot be replicated or synthesized using conventional methods.

### Defensive Posture

As awareness of their existence has spread among other factions, the Infernal Core has shifted toward a more defensive operational stance. Rather than rapid expansion, they focus on securing existing assets and developing countermeasures against specific threats:

**The Probability Shield Network** represents their primary defense against Solaris Nexus detection and assault. These devices create filtered dimensional barriers that selectively block purified energy while allowing corrupted forms to pass through unimpeded. When deployed around Core facilities, they render Solaris purification weapons significantly less effective and prevent their scrying techniques from penetrating beyond surface appearances. The Network requires continuous adjustment as Solaris develops new detection methods, creating an ongoing technological arms race between the factions.

**Evolutionary Containment Systems** address the unique threat posed by Primordial Genesis bioforms. These specialized chambers create localized dimensional distortions that dramatically slow or entirely prevent evolutionary processes, rendering Genesis's primary weapons ineffective within Core installations. Portable versions equip field operatives with limited protection against unexpected encounters with evolved entities, though these smaller devices can only maintain effect for short durations before requiring recharging through sacrificial energy.

**Temporal Anchoring Arrays** counter Aeonic Dominion interference by creating stabilized causality bubbles around critical Core infrastructure and operations. Within these bubbles, time flows according to fixed rules impervious to external manipulation, preventing chronomancers from altering event sequences or probability outcomes. The Arrays consume enormous energy but provide essential protection for research initiatives that would otherwise be vulnerable to temporal sabotage. Recent versions incorporate insights gained from captured Aeonic technology, improving efficiency and stability.

**Psychic Dampening Fields** provide protection against Neuralis Conclave mental infiltration and control. These technologies operate by routing cognitive processes partially through dimensional space, creating thought patterns that conventional psychics cannot easily detect or influence. The most advanced versions generate false mental signatures that mislead psychic observers, presenting artificial thoughts and emotions while concealing actual intentions. Field operatives receive specialized implants that can activate these protections when psychic activity is detected in their vicinity.

**Contingency Collapse Protocols** represent the Core's final defense against existential threats. Each major facility contains systems designed to collapse dimensional barriers in catastrophic ways if capture appears imminent. These controlled breaches would release entities and energies capable of rendering the entire location uninhabitable to conventional life forms, preventing enemies from claiming Core technology while potentially creating new dimensional anomalies that could serve as seeds for future reestablishment. The psychological impact of witnessing such events—which typically include reality distortion effects that permanently traumatize observers—serves as a powerful deterrent against direct assault.
