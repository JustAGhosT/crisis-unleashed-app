# Infernal Core: Origin Story (Part 3 - Conflicts and Alliances)

## Major Conflicts

### The Purification Crusade

The Infernal Core managed to operate in relative secrecy for nearly two decades before their existence became known to the Solaris Nexus. The discovery occurred when a Solaris archeological expedition uncovered ancient texts referencing dimensional entities similar to The Patrons, which prompted deeper investigation into unusual energy signatures detected around the globe.

When Solaris scouts finally confirmed the existence of an Infernal Node—the Sanguine Cathedral in North Africa—the response was immediate and uncompromising. To the Solaris Nexus, with their belief in divine order and purified technology, the very existence of the Infernal Core represented an abomination—technology perverted through demonic influence and human corruption.

The resulting conflict, known as the Purification Crusade, began with a direct assault on the Sanguine Cathedral by Solaris Purifier units—specialized forces equipped with sanctified weaponry designed to disrupt dimensional energy. The attack achieved initial success, breaching the Cathedral's outer defenses before the Core could mount an organized response.

However, the Infernal Core's desperation triggered an unprecedented countermeasure. The Node's overseer, Archon Carmilla (formerly Dr. Vex), initiated what became known as a "Blood Cascade"—a sacrifice of nearly 80% of the facility's personnel to fuel a massive dimensional disruption. The resulting energy surge created a localized reality distortion that caused the attacking Solaris forces to experience their worst fears as physical manifestations.

The psychological horror inflicted on the Solaris troops was so profound that many survivors abandoned their faction upon return, unable to reconcile their experience with their faith. This outcome—corrupting the pure rather than merely defeating them—established the pattern for future Core defense strategies.

The Crusade continued for three years, with Solaris forces attacking four of the five major Nodes. Each confrontation followed a similar pattern: initial Solaris advantage through superior conventional forces, followed by increasingly desperate and ethically unconscionable Core countermeasures that ultimately drove the attackers back through psychological rather than physical devastation.

The conflict concluded not with victory for either side but with containment as the new objective. The Solaris Nexus, recognizing they lacked the means to completely eradicate the Infernal threat without catastrophic losses, established a network of sanctified monitoring stations around known Core facilities. These stations didn't prevent Core operations but created an early warning system and imposed limitations on the scale of their dimensional manipulations.

For their part, the Infernal Core discovered that Solaris technology—particularly their purification systems and divine algorithm implementations—contained principles that could stabilize certain aspects of their own dimensional technology. This led to a practice of targeted raids specifically to capture Solaris devices for reverse engineering, further entrenching the ongoing conflict.

### The Primordial Contamination

While the conflict with Solaris was primarily ideological, the Infernal Core's clash with Primordial Genesis emerged from direct territorial competition. As both factions sought to establish global networks—the Core through their Nodes and Genesis through their sanctuaries—inevitable overlap occurred in regions with unique properties valuable to both groups.

The first major confrontation happened in the Amazon basin, where the Crimson Nexus Node and a Genesis cultivation site unknowingly established operations within fifty kilometers of each other. The proximity created unforeseen consequences as the Node's dimensional energy began affecting Genesis evolutionary accelerants, while Genesis bioenergetic fields disrupted the Node's delicate calibrations.

Initial contact was diplomatic, with representatives from both factions meeting to discuss potential compromise. The negotiations revealed crucial philosophical incompatibilities—Genesis viewed the Core's dimensional technology as fundamentally unnatural and corrupting to evolutionary processes, while the Core saw Genesis evolutionary methods as inefficient and constrained by biological limitations.

When diplomacy failed, both sides attempted to remove the other through their preferred methods. Genesis unleashed rapidly evolving organisms designed to break down dimensional technology, while the Core deployed probability manipulation fields to induce catastrophic mutations in Genesis evolutionary experiments.

The conflict escalated when the Core attempted a more direct approach—capturing several transformed Genesis members for experimentation, believing their evolved biology might be integrated with infernal technology to create superior hybrid systems. These experiments produced unexpected results—the Genesis biological components rejected dimensional energy in ways that caused cascading failures throughout connected Core systems.

Similarly, when Genesis attempted to purify captured Core technology through accelerated evolutionary processes, the result was not purification but contamination—the dimensional residue corrupted the very organisms meant to break it down, creating abominations that Genesis themselves were forced to destroy.

Both factions retreated from direct confrontation after these failures, establishing buffer zones around their territories and deploying specialized detection systems to avoid accidental proximity. However, the conflict established an enduring research objective for both groups—the Core sought to understand and eventually overcome the natural resistance of Genesis biology to dimensional energy, while Genesis worked to develop organisms capable of safely breaking down dimensional contamination.

### The Aeonic Interference

The most complex and frustrating conflict for the Infernal Core came not through direct confrontation but through subtle temporal interference from the Aeonic Dominion. As the Dominion's chronomancers detected the dimensional breaches created by Core technology, they identified these events as potential timeline fracture points—moments where reality itself could splinter into multiple divergent paths.

Rather than attacking Core facilities directly, Aeonic operatives began implementing subtle temporal adjustments around them—minor changes to causal chains that, while seemingly insignificant, would compound to prevent certain research breakthroughs or cause specific experiments to fail at critical moments.

From the Core's perspective, these interventions manifested as inexplicable strings of bad luck. Crucial components would fail despite multiple redundancies. Key personnel would experience sudden inspiration to question previously accepted procedures. Carefully calibrated experiments would produce results contradicting all previous trials.

It took years for the Core to recognize these occurrences as deliberate external interference rather than random chance or errors in their methodology. The breakthrough came when an Ascended researcher named Malphias, who had integrated temporal perception enhancements into his transformations, detected subtle chronon particle fluctuations immediately preceding a catastrophic reactor failure.

Once aware of the interference, the Core developed countermeasures—dimensional anchoring technology that created localized zones of temporal stability, making Aeonic manipulation more difficult within their facilities. However, this solution consumed significant energy and required constant maintenance, imposing new constraints on their operations.

The conflict never evolved into open warfare, as direct confrontation between dimensional and temporal technologies proved catastrophically unpredictable in test scenarios. Instead, it settled into a pattern of move and countermove—Aeonic operatives finding new methods of temporal influence, the Core developing increasingly sophisticated anchoring technologies to counter them.

This ongoing struggle substantially slowed the Core's technological advancement, particularly in areas involving dimensional portal expansion. Many Core leaders came to view the Aeonic Dominion as perhaps their most dangerous opponent—not for their direct power, but for their ability to prevent the Core from achieving breakthrough advancements through subtle manipulation of probability and causality.

## Uneasy Alliances

### The Umbral Partnership

The relationship between the Infernal Core and Umbral Eclipse evolved from mutual suspicion to strategic partnership through shared opposition to Solaris Nexus. Initial contact occurred when Eclipse shadow operatives, investigating unusual energy signatures, infiltrated the outer security perimeter of the Shadow Confluence Node beneath Tokyo.

Rather than eliminating the infiltrators, Node overseer Archon Noctis chose to reveal himself and propose a meeting between faction representatives. This unprecedented openness stemmed from intelligence suggesting Eclipse possessed advanced information-gathering technologies that might be adapted to help stabilize dimensional breaches—a persistent challenge in Core operations.

The resulting negotiation established what became known as the "Shadow Covenant"—a limited exchange arrangement that benefited both factions. The Core gained access to Eclipse information networks and shadow technology that could help conceal dimensional energy signatures, while Eclipse received controlled access to probability manipulation technology and limited dimensional enhancement for their stealth systems.

Neither faction harbored illusions about friendship or shared values. The Core recognized Eclipse as opportunists who would abandon the alliance the moment it ceased being beneficial, while Eclipse viewed the Core as dangerously unstable partners whose technology might eventually consume them. Nevertheless, the partnership endured because each provided capabilities the other lacked.

The primary constraint on this alliance was the Core's insistence on blood sacrifice for their technology to function and Eclipse's equally firm requirement for consent in all operations. This led to the development of specialized interfaces—Eclipse operatives who required dimensional enhancements would provide their own blood for the necessary rituals, maintaining the principle of personal choice while satisfying Core technological requirements.

This compromise created a precedent that influenced how the Core presented itself to potential allies—emphasizing the consent aspect of their philosophy while downplaying the more exploitative elements of their operation. It marked the beginning of a more sophisticated approach to external relations beyond simple intimidation or secrecy.

### The Neuralis Experiments

The most ethically complex relationship developed between the Infernal Core and the Neuralis Conclave. Initial contact occurred when Neuralis psychics detected the disturbed mental patterns of sacrifices within Core facilities—the psychic echoes of pain creating distinctive ripples in the collective unconscious that drew Conclave investigation.

The confrontation that followed nearly erupted into open conflict until a senior Neuralis representative made an unexpected proposal. Rather than opposing Core practices outright, they suggested a research partnership exploring the relationship between dimensional energy and psychic phenomena—areas where both factions had complementary expertise.

The resulting collaboration, conducted in specially constructed neutral facilities, focused on the effects of dimensional exposure on consciousness and the potential for psychic abilities to control or direct dimensional energy. Both sides maintained strict protocols—Core representatives could not conduct unwilling sacrifices within the research zone, while Neuralis operatives could not attempt mental domination of Core personnel.

These experiments produced significant advancements for both factions. The Core developed new understanding of how consciousness interfaces with dimensional energy, leading to more efficient transformation processes with reduced pain requirements. Neuralis gained insights into expanding psychic perception across dimensional boundaries, allowing their most advanced practitioners to sense entities and events beyond conventional reality.

However, the partnership remained deeply controversial within both organizations. Conclave moderates viewed any cooperation with the Core as moral contamination, while Core traditionalists considered the compromise on sacrificial requirements a dangerous deviation from necessary principles. These tensions created fluctuating levels of cooperation, with periods of productive exchange followed by years of minimal contact as internal factional politics shifted.

Despite these challenges, the relationship persisted because both groups recognized the existential threats they faced from other factions. The Neuralis understood that Solaris considered them heretics for their mental manipulation, making them potential targets for purification, while the Core knew they lacked the psychic defenses to counter direct Neuralis assault if relations collapsed completely. This mutual vulnerability created a tenuous but enduring detente.
