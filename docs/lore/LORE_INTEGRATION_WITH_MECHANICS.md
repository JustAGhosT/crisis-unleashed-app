# Lore Integration with Mechanics

This document outlines how the game's lore is integrated with its mechanics.

## Factions

Each faction's mechanics are designed to reflect its lore. For example, the Solaris Nexus faction is a technologically advanced society, so its mechanics are focused on using technology to gain an advantage.

## Heroes

Each hero's abilities are designed to reflect their personality and backstory. For example, Commander Eva is a skilled military commander, so her abilities are focused on leading her troops to victory.

## Cards

Each card's art and mechanics are designed to reflect its lore. For example, the "Solar Flare" card is a powerful spell that deals a large amount of damage, so its art depicts a massive explosion.
