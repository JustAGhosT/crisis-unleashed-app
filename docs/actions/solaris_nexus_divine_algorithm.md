# Divine Algorithm

**Faction**: Solaris Nexus  
**Energy Cost**: 3  
**Type**: Instant  
**Rarity**: Rare

## Effect

Immediately after this card resolves, you must declare a card type (Unit, Action, or Structure). If the very next card your opponent plays during their next turn is of the declared type, its effects are negated, and you deal 2 damage to the enemy hero. The prediction only applies to the single next card played.

## Strategy

- Best used when you can predict your opponent's strategy based on the board state and their faction.
- Counters game-winning plays or high-impact cards by forcing the opponent to play sub-optimally or risk negation.
- Combines well with card draw to see more of your opponent's options.

## Upgrades

- **Tier 2**: Reduce cost by 1 if you've played another Solaris Nexus card this turn.
- **Tier 3**: Deal 1 additional damage for each Solaris Nexus card you control.
