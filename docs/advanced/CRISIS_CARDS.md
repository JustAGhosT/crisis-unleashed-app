# Crisis Cards System

## Card Design Guidelines

- **Round-Long Effects**: Most Crisis Cards last for one full round
- **Balanced Impact**: Effects should never completely prevent a strategy, but rather modify gameplay
- **Counterplay**: Always include at least one way to mitigate or benefit from the crisis

## Effect Categories

1. **Resource Modifiers**
   - Example: "Power Surge: All players gain +1 Power at the start of their turn"
   - Limit: Maximum ±2 Power adjustment

2. **Lane Effects**

   - Example: "Frozen Tundra: Front Lane units have -1 Power"
   - Limit: Affects maximum 2 lanes

3. **Unit Modifiers**

   - Example: "Ancient Curse: All units with 3 or less Power are destroyed"
   - Limit: Should affect ≤50% of average board state

4. **Special Rules**

   - Example: "Dimensional Rift: Units can be deployed to any lane this turn"
   - Limit: One major rule change per card

## Balancing Guidelines

- **Frequency**: 1 Crisis Card per round
- **Duration**: Typically 1 round (some may last 2 rounds)
- **Impact Scale**:
  - Minor: Affects 1-2 units per player
  - Moderate: Affects 1 lane or 3-4 units
  - Major: Affects multiple lanes or all units
