# Quantum Evolution System

## Overview

The Quantum Evolution system is a new mechanic that allows heroes to evolve into more powerful forms. This system is only available to a select few heroes, and each hero has their own unique evolution path. Quantum Evolution represents a hero transcending their normal limitations by harnessing quantum energies that exist across multiple realities.

## How it Works

To evolve a hero, you must first collect a certain number of Quantum Shards. Quantum Shards can be obtained by completing certain tasks, such as winning battles or completing quests. Once you have enough Quantum Shards, you can use them to evolve your hero.

### Quantum Shard Acquisition

Quantum Shards can be obtained through the following methods:

* **Victory Rewards**: Each PvP victory grants 1-3 Quantum Shards based on the rank difference
* **Milestone Achievements**: Complete specific hero-related achievements to earn 5-10 Quantum Shards
* **Quantum Events**: Special timed events can award large quantities (15-25) of Quantum Shards
* **Faction Alignment**: Heroes receive bonus shards when played with their aligned faction cards
* **Reality Rifts**: Found randomly during gameplay, these time-limited portals yield 3-8 Quantum Shards

### Evolution Process

1. **Collection Phase**: Accumulate the required number of Quantum Shards for your hero (typically 50-100 depending on hero tier)
2. **Resonance Calibration**: Activate the Quantum Resonator in the hero menu when enough shards are collected
3. **Path Selection**: Choose which evolutionary path to pursue (Convergent, Divergent, or Transcendent)
4. **Trials Completion**: Complete a series of 3-5 specialized challenges unique to your chosen path
5. **Final Transformation**: Upon completion of all trials, the hero undergoes Quantum Evolution

### Evolution Stability

Once evolved, heroes may experience Quantum Instability:

* Stability rating ranges from 0-100%
* Heroes below 50% stability may randomly revert to pre-evolution state during matches
* Stability can be increased through consistent use of the evolved form
* Quantum Stabilizers (rare items) can be used to instantly increase stability by 25%

## Evolution Paths

Each hero has their own unique evolution path. These paths are designed to be challenging, and they will require you to use all of your skills to complete them. However, the rewards for completing an evolution path are well worth the effort.

### Path Types

#### Convergent Evolution

Convergent Evolution focuses on enhancing and perfecting a hero's existing abilities and playstyle.

* **Requirements**: 50 Quantum Shards, 25 victories with the hero
* **Benefits**:
  * Enhanced base statistics (approximately +25% to primary stats)
  * Reduced cooldowns on signature abilities (typically 1-2 turns reduction)
  * Unlocks advanced versions of existing abilities
* **Challenges**: Trials focus on mastery of the hero's base mechanics
* **Visual Changes**: Subtle enhancements to the hero's appearance, primarily color shifts and energy auras

#### Divergent Evolution

Divergent Evolution transforms a hero by introducing new mechanics and alternative playstyles.

* **Requirements**: 75 Quantum Shards, 15 victories against counter-heroes
* **Benefits**:
  * Grants 1-2 entirely new abilities
  * Changes hero classification (may shift from support to damage, etc.)
  * Introduces unique mechanics specific to the evolved form
* **Challenges**: Trials require adaptation to entirely new playstyles
* **Visual Changes**: Dramatic alteration of appearance, often with new weapons or physical changes

#### Transcendent Evolution

The rarest and most difficult path, Transcendent Evolution completely reimagines the hero with legendary power.

* **Requirements**: 100 Quantum Shards, 5 consecutive victories with the hero, defeat of 3 legendary opponents
* **Benefits**:
  * Complete ability rework with increased power ceiling
  * Unique passive that can influence the entire battlefield
  * Special interaction with aligned faction cards
* **Challenges**: Extremely difficult trials across multiple gameplay dimensions
* **Visual Changes**: Complete visual overhaul with unique animations and effects

## Hero-Specific Evolution Examples

### Commander Eva (Solaris Nexus)

* **Convergent**: Solar Admiral Eva
  * Enhanced solar abilities with larger AoE radius and lingering damage effects
  * "Solar Flare" cooldown reduced by 2 turns
  * New passive: "Solar Sovereignty" - Allied units gain 10% increased damage in Eva's light radius

* **Divergent**: Twilight Arbiter Eva
  * Gains ability to harness both solar and lunar energies
  * New ability: "Lunar Eclipse" - Creates shadow zones that reduce enemy visibility
  * Classification shifts from support/damage to controller/tactician

* **Transcendent**: Celestial Nexus Eva
  * Complete rework as an embodiment of cosmic balance
  * Ultimate ability: "Astral Convergence" - Creates a miniature star that pulls enemies inward while healing allies
  * Unique passive: "Reality Anchor" - Immune to displacement effects and can stabilize reality rifts

### Apex (Solaris Nexus)

* **Convergent**: Apex Prime
  * Enhanced area damage with damage-over-time components
  * Ability to chain AoE effects for compounded damage
  * New passive: "Overwhelming Force" - Each consecutive AoE hit on the same target increases damage by 8%

* **Divergent**: Apex Infiltrator
  * Transforms from AoE specialist to single-target assassin
  * New ability: "Pinpoint Strike" - Teleports behind target and deals massive damage to a single enemy
  * Gains stealth capabilities and detection mechanics

* **Transcendent**: Apex Omnipresent
  * Exists simultaneously across multiple points on the battlefield
  * Ultimate ability: "Quantum Fragmentation" - Creates 3-5 duplicates that can act independently
  * Unique passive: "Everywhere and Nowhere" - Can attack from any allied unit's position once per turn

### The Herald (Solaris Nexus)

* **Convergent**: The Grand Herald
  * Enhanced form-switching with reduced transition time
  * Both forms gain 30% increased effectiveness in their primary roles
  * New passive: "Dual Mastery" - Retains benefits of previous form for 2 turns after switching

* **Divergent**: Herald of Chaos
  * Gains a third "chaotic" form that combines aspects of melee and ranged combat
  * New ability: "Reality Distortion" - Attacks ignore shields and 50% of armor
  * Can rapidly cycle between all three forms with cumulative bonuses

* **Transcendent**: The Eternal Herald
  * Ascends beyond physical forms to become a being of pure energy
  * Ultimate ability: "Paradigm Shift" - Temporarily alters fundamental gameplay rules for all players
  * Unique passive: "Beyond Duality" - No longer restricted to forms, can freely combine all abilities

## Gameplay Impact

### Balance Considerations

The Quantum Evolution system is carefully balanced to ensure it doesn't create power imbalances:

1. **Resource Investment**: The high cost of evolution in terms of Quantum Shards ensures players must commit significant time and resources
2. **Specialized Counters**: Each evolved form has specific counters that can be deployed strategically
3. **Stability Mechanics**: The instability system prevents evolved heroes from dominating consistently
4. **Seasonal Resets**: Evolution progress partially resets each season, requiring ongoing engagement

### Strategic Implications

Evolved heroes create new strategic dimensions:

* **Team Composition**: Teams can be built around supporting evolved heroes' unique abilities
* **Counter-picking**: Knowledge of opponents' evolution paths enables effective counter-selection
* **Resource Management**: Players must decide which heroes to evolve based on their playstyle and meta
* **Adaptation Requirements**: Opponents must adapt strategies when facing evolved heroes
