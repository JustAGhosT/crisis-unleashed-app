# Hero Progression: The Quantum Evolution System

## Overview

Quantum Evolution is the pinnacle of hero progression in Crisis Unleashed. It is a late-game system that allows max-level heroes to transcend their standard limitations, unlocking new levels of power, unique abilities, and stunning visual upgrades. This system is designed to provide long-term goals for players and introduce new strategic depth to the metagame.

## Achieving Quantum Evolution

Before a hero can undergo Quantum Evolution, they must first meet several prerequisites:

1. **Reach Max Level**: The hero must have reached the maximum standard level through regular gameplay.
2. **Complete All Heroic Paths**: Both of the hero's Heroic Path trees must be fully unlocked.
3. **Gather Quantum Essence**: Players must collect a rare resource called Quantum Essence.

### Quantum Essence

Quantum Essence is a special, account-bound resource that is essential for triggering a hero's evolution. It can be acquired through several means:

- **Duplicate Hero Shards**: Obtaining duplicate shards for a hero that is already at max level will convert those shards into Quantum Essence.
- **High-Level Play**: Winning matches in the highest competitive tiers has a chance to award Quantum Essence.
- **Crisis Events**: Successfully completing challenging, high-difficulty Crisis Events can yield Quantum Essence as a reward.
- **Special Achievements**: Unlocking specific late-game achievements related to a hero will grant a one-time sum of Quantum Essence.

## The Evolution Process

Once a hero is eligible, the player can initiate the Quantum Evolution process from the hero's profile screen. The process consumes a significant amount of Quantum Essence and other in-game resources. Upon completion, the hero undergoes a fundamental transformation.

## Benefits of Quantum Evolution

A hero that has undergone Quantum Evolution gains several powerful benefits:

### 1. Quantum Levels

The hero's level cap is removed and replaced with a new "Quantum Level" progression track. Each Quantum Level provides a small, incremental stat boost, allowing for continued progression.

### 2. Evolved Abilities

One of the hero's core abilities is permanently upgraded into an "Evolved" form. This is not just a numerical increase but often a fundamental change to the ability's mechanics.

**Examples of Evolved Abilities:**

- **Lumina's Solar Flare** might evolve into **Supernova**, affecting all enemy lanes instead of just one.
- **Kairos's Eclipse Dominion** could evolve into **Eternal Night**, creating a permanent Dark Eclipse effect in a chosen lane.
- **Volk'tharr's Soul Feast** might evolve into **Soul Forge**, where slain minions grant him a permanent keyword in addition to stats.

### 3. Quantum Traits

The hero unlocks a new, powerful passive ability called a Quantum Trait. This trait is always active and is designed to complement their evolved playstyle.

**Examples of Quantum Traits:**

- **Aurex (Solaris Nexus)** might gain "**Cosmic Clairvoyance**," allowing the player to see the top card of their deck at all times.
- **Nyx (Umbral Eclipse)** could unlock "**Void Polarity**," causing her attack-reduction abilities to heal her for the amount reduced.
- **Zeth (Neuralis Conclave)** might get "**Reality Stabilizer**," making him immune to the effects of his own Reality Hack ability.

### 4. Visual Transformation

A hero's evolution is visually represented with a complete overhaul of their in-game model and card art. They gain a new, cosmically-infused appearance that signifies their ascended status. This includes new ability animations and visual effects.

## Multiple Quantum Tiers

Quantum Evolution is not a single step but a tiered process. There are multiple tiers of evolution (Quantum Tier 1, Quantum Tier 2, etc.), with each subsequent tier requiring more resources to unlock. Each new tier allows the player to evolve another of the hero's abilities and unlock an additional Quantum Trait, further specializing their power.

## Strategic Impact

Quantum Evolution has a significant impact on late-game strategy. An evolved hero becomes a central pillar of any deck, and their powerful new abilities can create new archetypes and deck-building possibilities. Players will need to consider not only how to best utilize their own evolved heroes but also how to counter the powerful new threats presented by their opponents' evolved heroes.
