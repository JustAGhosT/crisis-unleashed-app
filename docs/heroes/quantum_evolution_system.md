# Quantum Evolution System

## Overview

The Quantum Evolution system is a new mechanic that allows heroes to evolve into more powerful forms. This system is only available to a select few heroes, and each hero has their own unique evolution path.

## How it Works

To evolve a hero, you must first collect a certain number of Quantum Shards. Quantum Shards can be obtained by completing certain tasks, such as winning battles or completing quests. Once you have enough Quantum Shards, you can use them to evolve your hero.

## Evolution Paths

Each hero has their own unique evolution path. These paths are designed to be challenging, and they will require you to use all of your skills to complete them. However, the rewards for completing an evolution path are well worth the effort.
