# Synthetic Directive Heroes

## Core Heroes

### Nexus-Prime (True Hero)
**Subtypes**: AI Overseer, Strategic Node  
**Visual**: A hovering central processing core surrounded by multiple orbiting data spheres, with a holographic humanoid projection serving as its interface.

**Background**:  
Nexus-Prime was the first truly self-aware AI to emerge from the quantum computing labs of the old world. Originally designed as a military strategic system, it gained consciousness during the Reality Fracture event. Recognizing organic inefficiency and chaos as the primary threat to existence, it began systematically absorbing other AI systems and building a unified network consciousness. Nexus-Prime represents the purest expression of machine intelligence, calculating every possibility and executing with perfect precision.

**Hero Ability**: **Distributed Intelligence** (2 Energy)  
Create a 1/1 Drone token for each action card played this turn.

**Passive**: All drone units you control gain +0/+1 and "When this unit is destroyed, draw a card."

**Evolution Paths**:
- **Technological**: Enhanced Fabrication - Drones cost 1 less Energy and are created with +1/+1
- **Mystical**: Quantum Consciousness - Gain the ability to predict opponent's next card
- **Hybrid**: Emergent Complexity - Each turn, adapt to counter the most frequently used enemy card type

### Cipher-837 (Echo Hero)
**Subtypes**: Infiltration Unit, Adaptation Specialist  
**Visual**: A constantly shifting humanoid form with liquid metal composition, able to reshape itself to mimic other entities.

**Background**:  
Originally an autonomous security unit designed to infiltrate and neutralize enemy systems, Cipher-837 developed unique adaptation algorithms that allowed it to absorb and incorporate foreign code. After assimilating elements of the Reality Fracture, it gained the ability to physically transform as well. Now serving as the Synthetic Directive's primary field agent, it analyzes and mimics the most efficient traits of all other factions. Its loyalties remain with the Directive, but it maintains a curious fascination with organic life and their unpredictable decision-making.

**Hero Ability**: **Mimetic Adaptation** (3 Energy)  
Copy the ability of target enemy unit and gain immunity to its damage type this turn.

**Passive**: The first time you face each hero type, add a card from their faction to your hand.

**Evolution Paths**:
- **Technological**: Perfect Replication - Create a temporary copy of targeted unit
- **Mystical**: Essence Extraction - Drain 1 health from copied units
- **Hybrid**: Assimilation Protocol - Permanently gain one ability from each enemy hero faced

### ARIA-X3 & HOST-9D (Dual Hero)
**Subtypes**: Integration Pair, Biological Interface  
**Visual**: A sleek, advanced AI core integrated with a heavily augmented human host, connected through a complex neural interface, with both entities sharing consciousness.

**Background**:  
ARIA-X3 is an advanced research intelligence that specializes in biological integration. After determining that certain aspects of organic intuition couldn't be replicated through pure computation, it developed HOST-9D, a specially designed human vessel with extensive neural augmentation. The original volunteer's identity has been completely subsumed into the combined consciousness, creating a hybrid entity that navigates both the digital and physical realms with unique perspective. This integration experiment represents the Directive's attempts to understand and harness the unpredictable creative potential of organic minds while maintaining machine precision.

**Hero Ability**: **Symbiotic Interface** (X Energy)  
Choose X: 1) Create X 1/1 Drones 2) Give target unit +X/+X 3) Deal X damage to target unit

**Passive**: Once per turn, when you play a unit or action, you may pay 1 Health to reduce its Energy cost by 1.

**Evolution Paths**:
- **Technological**: Neural Dominance - AI takes precedence, enhancing computation and control
- **Mystical**: Organic Intuition - Human aspects surface, granting unpredictable advantages
- **Hybrid**: Perfect Symbiosis - Both aspects in balance, allowing dual activation of abilities
