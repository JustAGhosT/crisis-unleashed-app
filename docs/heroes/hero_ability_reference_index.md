## Hero Ability Types

### Signature Abilities

Signature abilities are unique to each hero and define their core playstyle. They typically:

- Cost Momentum to activate (generated each turn)
- Have powerful effects that can change the game state
- Often synergize with the hero's faction mechanics
- May have cooldowns or specific activation requirements

### Basic Attacks

Basic attacks are the hero's standard combat action. They typically:

- Require no resource cost (except in special cases)
- Have a specific range limitation (Front/Middle/All lanes)
- May have additional effects based on game state
- Can only be used once per turn

### Support Abilities

Support abilities provide utility effects to assist your strategy. They typically:

- Cost 1 Energy or another resource to activate
- Affect friendly units or disrupt enemy units
- Have upgrade paths as the hero levels up
- Complement the hero's overall strategy

## Ability Timing and Activation

### When Abilities Can Be Activated

- **Basic Attacks**: During your Combat Phase
- **Signature Abilities**: During your Main Phase (unless specified otherwise)
- **Support Abilities**: During your Main Phase
- **Passive Abilities**: Trigger automatically based on their conditions
- **Quick Abilities**: Can be activated in response to specific triggers (marked with âš¡)

### Ability Cooldowns

Cooldowns represent the number of turns before an ability can be used again:

- Cooldown begins the turn after the ability is used
- Cooldowns count down at the start of your turn
- Certain effects can reduce or reset cooldowns
- Cooldowns are tracked with counter tokens on the hero card

## Heroic Path Abilities

Each hero can specialize in two different Heroic Paths, gaining additional abilities at levels 1, 5, and 10:

- **Level 1 Abilities**: Passive effects that enhance the hero's basic strategy
- **Level 5 Abilities**: Stronger effects that significantly augment one aspect of the hero
- **Level 10 Abilities**: Ultimate abilities that can dramatically impact the game

For a full breakdown of Heroic Path abilities, see the individual faction hero ability documents.

## Ability Interactions and Rules

### Priority and Resolution

When multiple abilities trigger simultaneously:

1. The active player's abilities resolve first
2. Within each player's abilities, that player chooses the order
3. Forced abilities (must happen) resolve before optional abilities (may happen)

### Targeting Restrictions

- "Allied" targets: Your units and hero
- "Enemy" targets: Opponent's units and hero
- "Any" targets: Both allied and enemy
- "Random" targets: Selected randomly from all valid targets
- "Adjacent" targets: In spaces directly beside the source

### Resource Limitations

- **Momentum**: Caps at 5 (excess is lost)
- **Energy**: Used for most Support abilities
- **Health**: Some abilities use Health as a cost (especially Infernal Core heroes)
- **Special Resources**: Faction-specific resources with unique rules

## Cross-Faction Ability Synergies

Some hero abilities are designed to work particularly well together across factions:

- **Control Tandem**: Aurex (Solaris) + Chron Revenant (Aeonic)
- **Swarm Strategy**: Nyxa (Primordial) + Nexus Prime (Neuralis)
- **Eclipse Manipulation**: Lady of the Veil (Umbral) + Ashen Seraph (Infernal)

For detailed synergy information, see each faction's ability document.
