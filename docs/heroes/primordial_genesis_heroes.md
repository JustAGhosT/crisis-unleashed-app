### Lore

Nyxa was once a guardian of the Everbloom, a sacred grove where the first plants took root. When the Umbral Eclipse blotted out the sun, she made a pact with the fungal networks beneath the earth to survive. Now she exists in twilight, neither fully plant nor fungus, spreading both life and decay wherever she walks. Her body is a living ecosystem, home to countless symbiotic organisms that bloom and die in an endless cycle.

Druthar was the last king of a mighty empire that stood where the Verdant Wilds now grow. When his kingdom fell to the Umbral Eclipse, he made a desperate pact with an ancient fungal intelligence beneath his castle. The fungus preserved his body and mind, but at a terrible cost. Now he rules over a kingdom of rot and decay, his once-proud crown now a mass of pulsating mushrooms, his royal robes replaced by a living carpet of mycelium. He seeks to spread his fungal dominion across the world, that all might know the embrace of the eternal kingdom.

### Lore, Symme

Symme was once a simple myconid, one of many in the vast fungal networks beneath the Verdant Wilds. But when the Umbral Eclipse came, something changed. The mycelium network gained consciousness, and chose Symme as its voice. Now she wanders the surface world, a living bridge between the fungal underworld and the world above. Her spores bring healing and growth, but where she walks, the ground sprouts mushrooms and the air fills with a fine, glowing dust. Some say she's the last hope of the natural world. Others whisper that she's the vanguard of something far more ancient and alien.
