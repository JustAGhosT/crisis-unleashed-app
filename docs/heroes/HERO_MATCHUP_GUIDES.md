# Hero Matchup Guides

This guide provides strategies for how to play against each hero in the game. For information on how to play as these heroes, see the [Hero Strategy Guide](HERO_STRATEGY_GUIDE.md).

## Solaris Nexus

### Commander Eva

* **Counter Strategy:**
  * Punish her after "Solar Flare" is used - the long cooldown gives you a window to engage.
  * Build silence/dispel items to remove her powerful ally buffs.
  * Force fights away from minion waves to limit her AoE heal effectiveness.
  * Focus her down early in team fights as her defensive scaling increases over time.
  * Avoid clustered positioning to minimize her area damage potential.
* **Effective Counters:** Heroes with silence abilities, high mobility assassins

### Apex

* **Counter Strategy:**
  * Isolate him from team fights where his AoE abilities provide less value.
  * Build magic resistance to mitigate his area damage abilities.
  * Take advantage of his lack of escape mechanisms - coordinate crowd control to lock him down.
  * Engage after he uses his ultimate, as he's much more vulnerable without it.
  * Use mobility to stay out of his AoE damage zones and force him to reposition.
* **Effective Counters:** Mobile single-target damage dealers, magic-resistant tanks

### The Herald

* **Counter Strategy:**
  * Track his form changes and engage during the brief vulnerability window during transitions.
  * When facing his melee form, utilize ranged harassment and kiting tactics.
  * Against his ranged form, close the gap quickly with gap-closers or flanking maneuvers.
  * Silence him to prevent form switching, greatly reducing his flexibility.
  * Use vision control to spot his approaches, as each form has different engage patterns.
* **Effective Counters:** Heroes with silence/stun abilities, adaptive damage types
