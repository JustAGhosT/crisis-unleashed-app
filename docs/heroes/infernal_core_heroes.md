### Lore

Forged in the heart of a dying star, Volk'tharr is an ancient entity of pure hunger. It was imprisoned beneath the Obsidian Spires for millennia, until cultists of the Infernal Core accidentally set it free. Now it roams the land, consuming everything in its path. Each soul it devours makes it stronger, and its appetite only grows with every meal. The more it eats, the more it becomes a living black hole, warping reality around it with its insatiable hunger.

### Lore

Once a high-ranking Solaris angel, Ashen Seraph led the celestial host against the forces of the Infernal Core. But when the Solaris abandoned her to die in battle, she made a pact with the very demons she once fought. Now she serves the Infernal Core, her once-radiant wings now wreathed in eternal flames. She burns with hatred for her former kin, and her very presence ignites the air around her. Some say she seeks redemption through destruction, while others believe she's simply embraced her fall from grace.

### Lore

Kythea was a paladin of the Solaris Nexus, sworn to protect the innocent. When her entire order was slaughtered by Umbral assassins, she made a desperate prayer for the power to avenge them. The Infernal Core answered, offering her the strength she sought... at a price. Now she walks the line between light and darkness, her holy powers tainted by infernal energy. The more she taps into her cursed power, the more she risks losing herself to the demonic forces within. But she doesn't care - she'll burn the world to ashes if it means destroying those who took everything from her.
