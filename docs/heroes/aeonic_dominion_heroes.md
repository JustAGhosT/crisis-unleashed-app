A living paradox, the Chron Revenant exists simultaneously in all moments of time.

Now it drifts through the ages, a ghostly reminder that some things cannot be changed... or can they?

### Lore

Born from a timeline that no longer exists, the Anachronite is a living paradox, a being composed of forgotten memories and discarded possibilities. It remembers every possible future and past simultaneously, making it both incredibly wise and perpetually confused. Some say it's searching for a timeline where it can finally rest, while others believe it's trying to prevent a catastrophe only it can remember.
