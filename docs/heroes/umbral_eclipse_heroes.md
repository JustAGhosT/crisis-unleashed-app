No one knows the true origins of the Lady of the Veil. She appears in Umbral courts and Solaris palaces alike, her true face forever hidden behind an ever-shifting mask of shadows. Some say she was once a noblewoman who made a pact with the darkness, while others believe she is the personification of betrayal itself. What is certain is that where she walks, trust dies and alliances crumble.

But with each new face they steal, the less remains of the person they used to be.
