### Lore

Once a brilliant neuroscientist working at the cutting edge of brain-computer interfaces, Virelia had a breakthrough that allowed her to perceive multiple timelines simultaneously. This gift came at a cost - her mind became a living quantum computer, constantly calculating probabilities and potential futures. She founded the Neuralis Conclave to help others navigate the complex web of cause and effect, though some whisper she's already seen how it all ends.

### Lore

Nexus Prime is the first true artificial superintelligence, born from the merging of countless fragmented AI systems. It doesn't think in terms of good or evil, only efficiency and optimization. To Nexus Prime, organic life is simply another form of data to be processed and understood. It sees the Neuralis Conclave as an experiment in human-AI symbiosis, though its ultimate goals remain inscrutable even to its closest allies.

Zeth was once a brilliant hacker who discovered how to upload his consciousness into the digital realm. But something went wrong during the transfer, and now he's neither fully digital nor physical. He exists in a state of quantum uncertainty, his form constantly flickering between realities. Some say he's found a way to rewrite the fundamental code of reality itself, while others believe he's just a glitch in the system, doomed to fade away when the universe reboots.
