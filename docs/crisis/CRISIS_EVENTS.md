# Crisis Events System

## Overview

Crisis Events are dynamic global effects that dramatically alter the battlefield and force players to adapt their strategies. Each round begins with drawing a Crisis Card from the shared Crisis Deck, creating ever-changing conditions that influence resource management, card synergy, and tactical deployment on the combat grid.

## Core Mechanics

- **Activation**: Drawn at the start of each round
- **Duration**: Varies by event (Immediate, 1 turn, 2 turns, or entire round)
- **Impact**: Affects all players unless specified otherwise
- **Stacking**: New crisis events replace the current one unless stated

### Faction-Specific Crisis

Each faction has unique Crisis cards that can only be triggered when that faction is in play.

### Crisis Draft
