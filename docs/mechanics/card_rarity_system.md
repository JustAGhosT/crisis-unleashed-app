# Card Rarity System

## Overview

The Crisis Unleashed card rarity system establishes the relative scarcity and power level of cards within the game. Rarity influences card acquisition rates, deck building constraints, visual presentation, and overall game balance. This document defines the complete rarity framework and its implications for gameplay.

## Rarity Tiers

Crisis Unleashed features six primary rarity tiers, each with distinct characteristics:

## WORM Card Classification

WORM (Weavers Of Reality & Memory) cards represent a special category that exists outside the standard rarity system:

**Visual Indicator**: Reality-warping frame with unique prismatic effects
**Power Level**: Reality-altering abilities with game-changing effects
**Deck Building**: Extremely restricted (maximum 1 WORM card per deck, starts in Reality Nexus zone)

## Drop Rates and Acquisition

### Standard Pack Distribution

Each 10-card pack contains:

- 7 Common cards
- 2 Uncommon cards
- 1 card of Rare or higher rarity

The exact distribution of the guaranteed Rare+ slot follows this probability:

- Rare: 70% (7% overall)
- Epic: 20% (2% overall)
- Legendary: 10% (1% overall)
- Mythical: 0% (not available in standard packs)

### Pity Timer System

To prevent extended periods of bad luck, Crisis Unleashed implements a pity timer:

- Epic card guaranteed within 10 packs if none has been opened
- Legendary card guaranteed within 30 packs if none has been opened
- Pity timers are tracked separately per set

### Faction Distribution

Standard packs contain cards from all factions with equal distribution probability. Faction-specific packs (available through special promotions or achievements) contain:

- 70% cards from the specified faction
- 30% cards from other factions

### Special Acquisition Methods

#### Mythical Cards

- Tournament rewards (top placement)
- Achievement completion (collecting full sets, etc.)
- Special limited-time events
- Seasonal rewards (highest competitive tier)

#### WORM Cards

- Reality Fracture event participation
- Special in-game challenges
- Collection milestones
- Premium promotional events

### Crafting System

Players can craft cards using Fracture Shards, with costs based on rarity:

| Rarity | Shard Cost to Craft | Shard Return when Dismantled |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| Common | 50 | 10 |
| Uncommon | 100 | 20 |
| Rare | 300 | 75 |
| Epic | 1,200 | 300 |
| Legendary | 4,800 | 1,200 |
| Mythical | Not craftable | 2,400 |
| WORM | Not craftable | Not dismantlable |

## Rarity Design Principles

### Power Level Guidelines

Each rarity tier follows specific design principles:

#### Common Cards

- Basic effects with straightforward applications
- Foundation for faction mechanics
- Efficient costs for their effects
- Limited complexity

#### Uncommon Cards

- Enhanced versions of common effects
- Faction-specific utility
- Moderate complexity
- Versatile applications

#### Rare Cards

- Unique, powerful effects
- Specialized applications
- Cross-faction synergies
- Multiple decision points

#### Epic Cards

- Game-changing abilities
- Strong build-around effects
- Strategic centerpieces
- Multiple synergy vectors

#### Legendary Cards

- Defining, unique effects
- Strategic pillar cards
- Complex decision trees
- Meta-defining potential

#### Mythical Cards

- Transformative gameplay effects
- Story-significant characters or events
- Unique visual presentations
- Special animation treatments

### Rarity Power Balance

To maintain game balance while making higher-rarity cards desirable:

1. **Higher rarity ≠ strictly better**:
   - Higher rarity cards provide different options, not strictly stronger ones
   - Higher rarity often means more situational but powerful effects
   - A well-constructed deck of lower rarity cards should remain competitive

2. **Competitive viability across rarities**:
   - Tournament-winning decks typically include a mix of rarities
   - Some common cards remain staples even in high-level play
   - Higher rarity cards open up strategies rather than dominating all strategies

3. **Recognition factor**:
   - Higher rarity cards have more distinctive effects that create memorable moments
   - Visual treatment enhances the excitement of using higher rarity cards
   - Animation complexity scales with rarity (see Card Animation System)

#### Common

## Rarity Distribution by Faction

Each faction has a balanced distribution of cards across rarities, but with slight thematic variations:

| Faction | Common | Uncommon | Rare | Epic | Legendary | Mythical |
|---------|--------|----------|------|------|-----------|----------|
| Solaris Nexus | 35% | 30% | 20% | 10% | 4% | 1% |
| Umbral Eclipse | 30% | 30% | 25% | 10% | 4% | 1% |
| Aeonic Dominion | 30% | 30% | 25% | 10% | 4% | 1% |
| Primordial Genesis | 35% | 25% | 25% | 10% | 4% | 1% |
| Infernal Core | 30% | 30% | 25% | 10% | 4% | 1% |
| Neuralis Conclave | 30% | 30% | 25% | 10% | 4% | 1% |
| Synthetic Directive | 35% | 30% | 20% | 10% | 4% | 1% |

*Note: Percentages represent the proportion of unique cards in each faction's card pool, not drop rates.*

## Limited Format Rarity Considerations

### Draft Format

Rarities are adjusted for draft packs to ensure balanced gameplay:

- Common: 75%
- Uncommon: 20%
- Rare: 4%
- Epic: 0.9%
- Legendary: 0.1%
- Mythical: Not included in draft packs

### Sealed Format

Sealed format uses standard pack distributions but includes a guaranteed range of rarities:

- 6 packs per player
- Guaranteed minimum of 6 Rare cards
- Guaranteed minimum of 1 Epic card
- Legendary and Mythical cards appear at standard rates

## Rarity Evolution Through Sets

As new sets are released, the distribution and power level of rarities will evolve:

### Core Set

- Establishes baseline power for each rarity
- Higher proportion of Common and Uncommon cards
- Legendary cards focus on faction identity

### Expansion Sets

- Introduce more specialized mechanics
- Legendary cards that explore new territory
- Introduction of set-specific Mythical cards

### Legacy Management

As the card pool grows, older cards may be adjusted:

- Rarity upgrades/downgrades in reprints
- Rebalancing of older cards
- Rotation of sets in standard format

## Display and Collection Features

### Card Gallery

The collection interface organizes cards by:

- Set
- Faction
- Rarity
- Acquisition status

### Rarity Filters

Players can filter their collection and deck building by:

- Viewing only cards of specific rarities
- Sorting by rarity (ascending or descending)
- Highlighting unacquired cards by rarity

### Collection Achievements

Collection-based achievements include:

- Collecting all cards of a specific rarity
- Collecting all Legendary cards from a faction
