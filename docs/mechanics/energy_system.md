# Energy System Mechanics

## Core Energy Mechanics

### Energy Crystals

Energy Crystals are the primary resource in Crisis Unleashed, representing the concentrated dimensional energy that powers abilities, units, and actions across all factions.

**Key Properties:**
- Maximum capacity: 10 Energy Crystals per player
- Base regeneration: 1 Crystal per turn
- Visual representation: Faction-specific crystal design
- Cannot be stored between turns (unused Energy dissipates)

### Energy States

Energy Crystals exist in three possible states:

1. **Available**: Ready to be spent on cards and abilities
2. **Depleted**: Used this turn and unavailable until refreshed
3. **Locked**: Temporarily or permanently unavailable due to game effects

## Energy Acquisition

### Standard Acquisition

Players acquire Energy through several standard methods:

1. **Turn Refresh**: At the beginning of your turn:
   - Refresh all depleted Energy Crystals
   - Gain 1 additional Energy Crystal (up to maximum capacity)

2. **Card Effects**: Specific cards can provide Energy:
   - Immediate gain (e.g., "Gain 2 Energy")
   - Persistent effects (e.g., "Gain 1 Energy at the start of your turn")
   - Conditional effects (e.g., "When this unit takes damage, gain 1 Energy")

3. **Faction Synergies**: Each faction has unique Energy generation mechanics:
   - **Solaris Nexus**: Gain +1 Energy regeneration for every 2 Solaris Nexus cards in play
   - **Umbral Eclipse**: Can convert opponent's Energy loss into your gain
   - **Aeonic Dominion**: Can reduce ability costs through playing multiple cards
   - **Primordial Genesis**: Can sacrifice units or resources for Energy bursts
   - **Infernal Core**: Can convert health into Energy through sacrifice
   - **Neuralis Conclave**: Gains Energy through card draw and ability synergies
   - **Synthetic Directive**: Can redistribute Energy across networked units

### Energy Storage

Unlike many card games, Crisis Unleashed generally does not allow Energy to be stored between turns:

- Unused Energy dissipates at end of turn
- Exception: Specific cards or abilities may allow Energy storage
- Stored Energy typically uses special tokens distinct from standard Energy Crystals

## Energy Expenditure

### Standard Costs

Energy is spent on:

1. **Playing Cards**: Each card has an Energy cost in its upper right corner
2. **Activating Abilities**: Unit and Hero abilities often require Energy to activate
3. **Special Game Actions**: Certain game mechanics may require Energy expenditure

### Cost Modifications

Several effects can modify Energy costs:

1. **Reduction Effects**: Decrease the Energy cost
   - Faction synergies (e.g., Aeonic Dominion cost reduction)
   - Card-specific effects (e.g., "Your next Action costs 2 less")
   - Hero abilities (e.g., "Reduce the cost of Units by 1")
   
2. **Increase Effects**: Raise the Energy cost
   - Opponent disruption effects (e.g., "Enemy Actions cost 1 more")
   - Battlefield conditions (e.g., "All units cost 1 more to deploy")
   - Status effects (e.g., "Corrupted units' abilities cost 1 more")

3. **Cost Floor**: No cost can be reduced below 0 Energy
   - Exception: Cards specifically stating they can be played for 0 Energy

## Faction-Specific Energy Mechanics

### Solaris Nexus

**Divine Energy Cycle**
- For every 2 Solaris Nexus cards in play, gain +1 Energy regeneration per turn

- **Energy Matrix** (3 Energy): Gain +1 Energy at the start of each turn
- **Blessing of Light** (2 Energy): Reduce the Energy cost of Blessing effects by 1
- **Nexus Conduit** (4 Energy): Convert healing into Energy gain

### Umbral Eclipse

**Shadow Energy Manipulation**
- Energy costs increase for opponents in lanes with Umbral Eclipse units
- Can steal Energy from opponents through various effects
- Shadow Meld allows Energy conservation through bypassing normal costs

**Notable Cards:**
- **Energy Siphon** (3 Energy): Opponent loses 2 Energy, you gain 1 Energy
- **Void Conduit** (4 Energy): When opponent depletes all Energy, you gain 2 Energy
- **Shadow Economics** (2 Energy): Next 2 cards you play cost 1 less Energy

### Aeonic Dominion

**Temporal Energy Efficiency**
- Reduce ability costs based on unique Aeonic Dominion cards played this turn
- Can "borrow" Energy from future turns with certain abilities
- Time Dilation effects can duplicate Energy expenditure effects

**Notable Cards:**
- **Chrono Efficiency** (3 Energy): Reduce the cost of your next 3 cards by 1
- **Future Credit** (2 Energy): Gain 3 Energy now, skip Energy gain next turn
- **Energy Recursion** (4 Energy): Replay an Energy-generating card from your discard pile

### Primordial Genesis

**Organic Energy Cultivation**
- Can sacrifice growth counters for Energy bursts
- Root Network allows Energy sharing between connected units
- Adaptive growth can convert unused Energy into permanent buffs

**Notable Cards:**
- **Energy Bloom** (3 Energy): Create a structure that produces 1 Energy per turn
- **Gaia's Bounty** (4 Energy): Gain 1 Energy for each Primordial Genesis unit you control
- **Sacrifice Ritual** (2 Energy): Sacrifice a unit to gain Energy equal to its cost

### Infernal Core

**Chaos Energy Conversion**
- Can convert health into Energy through various risk/reward mechanics
- Hellfire Overclocking provides temporary Energy bursts with delayed costs
- Energy fluctuations can provide unpredictable resource advantages

**Notable Cards:**
- **Soul Harvest** (3 Energy): Lose 2 health, gain 3 Energy
- **Chaotic Surge** (4 Energy): Gain 1-5 Energy at random

## Advanced Energy Mechanics

### Energy Conversion

Some effects allow Energy to be converted into other resources:
- Convert Energy to card draw
- Convert Energy to unit stats
- Convert Energy to special actions

### Energy Disruption

Players can interact with opponent's Energy through:
- Energy destruction (opponent loses Energy)
- Cost increase effects (opponent pays more for actions)
- Energy locking (opponent temporarily cannot use certain Energy Crystals)
- Energy redirection (opponent's Energy gain is redirected)

### Energy Thresholds

Certain cards and abilities have effects that vary based on Energy availability:
- **Threshold effects**: "If you have X or more Energy..."
- **Scaling effects**: "Deal damage equal to your available Energy"
- **Cost variance**: "X Energy: Effect scales with Energy spent"

## Energy in Multiplayer

In games with more than two players:
- Energy mechanics function identically
- Certain cards affecting "all opponents" impact Energy for all other players
- Some abilities allow Energy sharing between allies in team games

## Energy Strategy Tips

### Energy Curve Considerations

When building a deck, consider the "Energy curve":
- Include cards of various Energy costs
- Balance low-cost early game cards with powerful high-cost cards
- Consider average Energy cost relative to your faction's generation potential

### Energy Efficiency

The player who uses Energy most efficiently often gains advantage:
- Aim to use all available Energy each turn
- Consider cards that provide alternative uses for excess Energy
- Balance expensive powerful effects with cheaper utility options

### Energy Disruption Strategy

When facing Energy disruption:
- Include low-cost options that remain playable under resource constraints
- Consider cards that generate Energy to offset opponent disruption
- Save key counterplay cards for protecting vital Energy-generating structures
