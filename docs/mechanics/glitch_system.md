# Glitch System

## Overview

The Glitch system represents reality anomalies caused by the Reality Fracture event. In gameplay terms, Glitches introduce unpredictable but strategic elements that can dramatically alter the game state. While primarily associated with the Umbral Eclipse faction, Glitch effects can appear across all factions in various forms.

## Glitch Fundamentals

### Types of Glitches

1. **Minor Glitches**: Small reality distortions with limited game impact
   - Typically affect a single unit or action
   - Usually last for 1-2 turns

2. **Major Glitches**: Significant reality warps that can change the course of a game
   - Affect multiple units, players, or game mechanics
   - May have persistent effects

3. **Critical Glitches**: Rare, game-altering anomalies that fundamentally change how the game functions
   - Can completely transform the battlefield or core rules
   - Often have permanent effects until specifically countered

### Glitch Tokens

Some cards place Glitch tokens on units, conditions, or game zones. These tokens represent the accumulation of reality distortions:

- 1-2 Glitch tokens: Minor effects
- 3-4 Glitch tokens: Major effects
- 5+ Glitch tokens: Critical effects

When a specific threshold is reached, the associated Glitch effect triggers automatically.

## Glitch Effects

### Data Corruption

Units affected by Data Corruption experience unpredictable alterations to their core functions:

- Stats may randomly increase or decrease each turn
- Abilities might activate at unexpected times
- Text on the card may be partially scrambled, creating new effects

### Reality Tears

Small ruptures in the fabric of reality that alter how specific game zones function:

- Cards may phase in and out of existence
- Costs for playing cards in affected zones may fluctuate
- Units may be teleported between zones unexpectedly

### Temporal Anomalies

Disruptions in the flow of time that affect turn sequence and ability timing:

- Actions may resolve in unpredictable order
- Effects might trigger multiple times
- Turn phases could be skipped or repeated

## Faction Interactions with Glitches

### Umbral Eclipse

Masters of the Glitch system, Umbral Eclipse can:
- Deliberately introduce Glitches for strategic advantage
- Control and direct the effects of existing Glitches
- Feed on Glitches to power their abilities

### Solaris Nexus

Views Glitches as dangerous imperfections:
- Can purify and remove Glitch effects
- Some units gain bonuses when countering Glitches
- Divine Algorithms can predict and mitigate Glitch outcomes

### Aeonic Dominion

Studies Glitches as temporal phenomena:
- Can stabilize or destabilize Glitches through time manipulation
- Creates controlled Glitches in specific timelines
- Gains information from analyzing Glitch patterns

### Primordial Genesis

Adapts to incorporate Glitch energy:
- Units can evolve to harness Glitch effects
- Some Primordial units are immune to negative Glitch effects
- Can absorb Glitches to fuel rapid growth

### Infernal Core

Amplifies and exploits Glitch chaos:
- Sacrificing units can create Glitch outbursts
- Combines Hellfire with Glitch energy for unpredictable results
- Some units become more powerful in heavily Glitched areas

### Neuralis Conclave

Studies Glitches through mental analysis:
- Can predict the outcome of random Glitch effects
- Psychic barriers can protect against Glitch corruption
- Can redirect Glitch effects to other targets

### Synthetic Directive

Analyzes and incorporates Glitch patterns:
- Drones can collect and store Glitch data for later use
- Processing Nodes can stabilize or weaponize Glitch effects
- Adaptive algorithms can predict and mitigate random Glitch outcomes

## Key Glitch Cards

### Umbral Eclipse

- **Glitch Cascade** (4 Energy): Place 2 Glitch tokens on up to three different game elements.
- **Reality Fracture** (5 Energy): Create a persistent Glitch Field that adds a Glitch token to any card that enters it.
- **Data Corruption** (3 Energy): Target enemy unit gains 3 Glitch tokens. When it reaches 5, you take control of it.

### Cross-Faction Cards

- **Glitch Stabilizer** (Solaris Nexus, 3 Energy): Remove all Glitch tokens from target unit or zone.
- **Temporal Glitch** (Aeonic Dominion, 4 Energy): Create a Glitch that causes target unit to act during your turn instead of the opponent's.
- **Glitched Evolution** (Primordial Genesis, 4 Energy): Target unit gains X/X where X is the number of Glitch tokens in play.

## Glitch Strategy

### Playing With Glitches

Effective use of the Glitch system requires:
- Strategic placement of Glitch tokens on high-value targets
- Timing Glitch activations to disrupt opponent plans
- Building deck resilience to your own Glitch effects
- Tracking Glitch tokens and anticipating thresholds

### Countering Glitches

To defend against Glitch strategies:
- Include Glitch removal in your deck if facing Umbral Eclipse
- Distribute your threats to avoid single-point vulnerability
- Consider cards with "whenever this card is targeted" effects
- Maintain flexibility in your game plan to adapt to unexpected changes

## Glitch Zones

Certain battlefield locations can become permanently Glitched during gameplay:

1. **Reality Tears**: Cards played in these zones cost 1 less but have a 20% chance to be countered.
2. **Quantum Flux**: Units in these zones randomly gain or lose 1/1 at the start of each turn.
3. **Temporal Anomaly**: Actions played from these zones can be played as if they had Flash.

*Note: Glitch effects are intentionally unpredictable. The exact outcome of some Glitch interactions may vary from game to game, representing the chaotic nature of reality distortions.*
