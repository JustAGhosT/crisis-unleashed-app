# WORM Cards: Weavers Of Reality & Memory

## Overview

WORM (Weavers Of Reality & Memory) cards represent unique entities that exist outside the normal faction structure. These powerful beings traverse the multiverse, manipulating the fundamental forces of existence. In gameplay terms, WORM cards offer special abilities that can dramatically alter the game state, provide unique strategic options, and often break or modify standard game rules.

## Core Mechanics

### WORM Card Types

1. **Reality Weavers**: Focus on altering the fundamental rules of the game
   - Can change how specific mechanics function
   - Often create persistent effects that remain until specifically countered
   - May introduce entirely new game elements

2. **Memory Weavers**: Focus on manipulating the game's history and card interactions
   - Can replay, alter, or prevent past actions
   - Often interact with discard piles and removed-from-game zones
   - May track and modify card usages throughout the game

### Acquisition and Deck Building

Unlike faction cards, WORM cards have special deck building rules:

- Maximum 1 WORM card can be included in any deck
- WORM cards do not count toward the deck's faction requirements
- WORM cards always start the game outside your deck in the Reality Nexus zone
- Most WORM cards require specific conditions to be met before they can be played

### Energy Requirements

WORM cards typically have two energy costs:

1. **Summoning Cost**: Energy required to bring the WORM card into your hand from the Reality Nexus
2. **Activation Cost**: Energy required to actually play the card from your hand

## Game Interactions

### Faction Synergies

WORM cards often have natural synergies with specific factions:

- **Chronos**: Strong synergies with Aeonic Dominion and Neuralis Conclave
- **Mnemosyne**: Works well with Umbral Eclipse and Solaris Nexus
- **Nexus**: Functions effectively with any faction but excels in multi-faction decks
- **Void**: Powerful with Infernal Core and Synthetic Directive
- **Echo**: Particularly effective with Neuralis Conclave and Umbral Eclipse

### Strategic Considerations

When including a WORM card in your deck:

1. **Timing**: Plan when to summon your WORM entity - too early and you may lack Energy for your main strategy, too late and you may miss key opportunities
2. **Win Condition**: Some decks use WORM cards as alternate win conditions
3. **Counter Play**: Be aware that WORM cards can be countered or disrupted by specific anti-WORM effects
4. **Resource Management**: WORM cards require significant Energy investment - ensure your deck can support this cost

### Counter-WORM Strategies

Each faction has methods to deal with WORM entities:

- **Solaris Nexus**: "Reality Anchor" prevents WORM cards from being summoned
- **Umbral Eclipse**: "Memory Void" can exile WORM cards from the Reality Nexus
- **Aeonic Dominion**: "Temporal Banishment" returns WORM cards to the Reality Nexus
- **Primordial Genesis**: "Primal Rejection" prevents WORM passive abilities from functioning
- **Infernal Core**: "Soul Consumption" can destroy WORM cards and convert them to Energy
- **Neuralis Conclave**: "Mind Blank" temporarily disables WORM card text
- **Synthetic Directive**: "Analytical Deconstruction" can copy and then nullify WORM abilities

## WORM Card Acquisition

WORM cards are among the rarest in Crisis Unleashed, requiring special conditions to add to your collection:

- Complete specific in-game achievements
- Participate in special Reality Fracture events
- Reach certain rank thresholds in competitive play
- Discover them through exploration of specific game modes
- Trade with other players through the Nexus Market

## Lore Significance

In the Crisis Unleashed universe, WORM entities are ancient beings that existed before the Reality Fracture. They possess awareness beyond normal entities, sometimes breaking the fourth wall or referring to game mechanics directly in their flavor text.

Their existence is tied to the stability of the multiverse, and their interventions often represent pivotal moments in the shifting balance between order and chaos. While factions may attempt to harness their power, WORM entities ultimately pursue their own inscrutable agendas.
