## Game Setup Sequence

### Starting the Game

1. **Determine first player** randomly (coin flip, die roll, or faction-specific method)
2. **First player places the turn indicator** in front of themselves
3. **All players examine their starting hands**
4. **Mulligan Phase**: Each player may mulligan (shuffle hand back and redraw, taking one fewer card) once
5. **Set starting Energy**: Each player starts with 1 Energy Crystal
6. **Prepare any faction-specific setup elements**:
   - Solaris Nexus: Place Blessing tokens in supply
   - Umbral Eclipse: Prepare Shadow tokens
   - Aeonic Dominion: Set up Timeline tracker
   - Primordial Genesis: Prepare Growth counters
   - Infernal Core: Set initial Chaos level to 0
   - Neuralis Conclave: Prepare Mind Link tokens
   - Synthetic Directive: Prepare Network tokens

### Hero Activation

1. **Each player reveals their Hero** simultaneously
2. **Apply any "When the game begins" Hero effects** in turn order
3. **Place any WORM cards** in the Reality Nexus (if using them)

## First Turn Procedure

The first player begins with these steps:

1. **Preparation Phase**: Skip Energy refresh on first turn only
2. **Draw Phase**: Draw 1 card
3. **Action Phase**: Play units, actions, use abilities
4. **Combat Phase**: No combat on first turn
5. **Resolution Phase**: End-of-turn effects trigger

*Note: The first player does not refresh Energy on their first turn but does receive the standard turn draw.*

## Special Setup Rules

### Team Game Setup (2v2)

- Teams sit across from each other
- Each team shares a life total (starting at 30 instead of 20)
- Energy remains individual to each player

### Draft Setup

- Each player opens 3 packs
- Draft in rotating order
- Minimum 30-card decks for draft format
- Basic Energy generation increased to 2 per turn

### Sealed Setup

- Each player receives 6 packs
- Build minimum 30-card decks
- Basic Energy generation increased to 2 per turn

## Faction-Specific Setup Notes

### Solaris Nexus Setup

- Place Blessing tokens (12) within reach
- Pre-charge Energy Matrix if included in deck
- Divine Algorithm cards can be arranged in designated order during setup

### Umbral Eclipse Setup

- Prepare Shadow tokens (8) within reach
- Secretly select one card from deck as "hidden agenda" if playing with Void Protocol
- If playing with Glitch cards, prepare Glitch tokens

### Aeonic Dominion Setup

- Set up Timeline tracker next to play area
- Prepare Temporal Markers (10) within reach
- Precognition cards may be looked at during setup phase

### Primordial Genesis Setup

- Prepare Growth counters (15) within reach
- If playing with Root Network, establish connection points
- Gaia's Blessing token is placed on Hero card

### Infernal Core Setup

- Set initial Chaos level to 0
- Sacrifice tokens (10) should be within reach

## Setup Troubleshooting

### Common Setup Issues

- **Insufficient Energy tokens**: Substitute with other counters if needed
- **Unclear card zones**: Use playmats or clearly mark zones with available objects
- **Mulligan confusion**: Remember, mulligan gives one fewer card than initial draw
- **Hero ability questions**: Refer to Hero guide or official rulings

### Preparing for Specific Opponent Factions

When facing specific factions, consider these setup adjustments:

- **vs. Solaris Nexus**: Prepare anti-Blessing counters
- **vs. Umbral Eclipse**: Consider anti-Glitch cards in opening hand
- **vs. Aeonic Dominion**: Be prepared for turn manipulation
- **vs. Primordial Genesis**: Include early removal for growth engines
- **vs. Infernal Core**: Prepare defensive options for early aggression
- **vs. Neuralis Conclave**: Consider anti-control cards in opening hand
- **vs. Synthetic Directive**: Include area effect removal for drone swarms

## Digital Implementation

When playing the digital version of Crisis Unleashed:

1. **Select your Hero and deck** from collection screen
2. **Enter matchmaking** or create a private game
3. **Wait for opponent connection** and hero selection
4. **System automatically handles** initial draw and mulligan offers
5. **Game begins** with first player automatically determined

## Setup Variants

### Quick Start Variant

- Both players start with 3 Energy Crystals
- Initial hand size increased to 6 cards
- No first-turn restrictions

### Commander Variant

- Heroes start in play with double health
- Starting hand size reduced to 4 cards
- Hero abilities can be used immediately

### Reality Fracture Variant

## Competitive Setup

In tournament settings, additional steps apply:

1. **Deck registration**: Submit deck list before tournament
2. **Deck check**: Random verification of contents
3. **Timed setup**: 3 minutes maximum for setup process
4. **Judge procedures**: Call a judge for any setup disputes

*Note: For beginners, we recommend playing with open hands for the first few turns until game mechanics become familiar. This tutorial approach isn't used in competitive play.*
