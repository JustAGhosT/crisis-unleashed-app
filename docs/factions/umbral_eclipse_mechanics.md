# Umbral Eclipse Mechanics

## Core Identity
Umbral Eclipse embodies shadow technology, operating in the digital dark spaces to manipulate, disrupt, and gather intelligence through digital stealth and data manipulation.

## Key Mechanics

### Void Disruption
Targeted ability disabling that prevents enemies from using their most powerful tools.

**Game Impact**: Creates strategic weaknesses in opponent's board position.

### Data Phantoms
Creating digital clones that can misdirect, absorb damage, or gather information.

**Game Impact**: Provides defensive flexibility and intelligence gathering.

### Glitch System
Introduces unpredictable effects and transformations to both friendly and enemy units.

**Game Impact**: Creates chaotic situations that Umbral Eclipse units are equipped to exploit.

## Playstyle Overview

### Early Game
Focus on intelligence gathering and disruption. Deploy low-cost shadow units that can gather information on opponent's hand or deck.

### Mid Game
Establish disruption fields that increase opponent's Energy costs while deploying phantoms to protect your key units.

### Late Game
Execute precision strikes using gathered intelligence, typically targeting crucial enemy support units or exploiting identified weaknesses.

## Synergies

### Internal Synergies
- Shadow units boost each other's evasion capabilities
- Data phantoms can trigger glitch effects on death
- Multiple disruption effects can completely lock down opponent options

### External Synergies
- **Infernal Core**: Chaos amplifies glitch effectiveness
- **Neuralis Conclave**: Mind manipulation complements information warfare
- **Primordial Genesis**: Provides sustainable targets for phantom copying

## Counter-Strategies
- Solaris Nexus purification can remove glitch effects
- Aeonic Dominion time manipulation can preempt disruption
- Wide board strategies are less vulnerable to targeted disruption
