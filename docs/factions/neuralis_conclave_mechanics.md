on with only drones or augmented humans and maybe a sl# Neuralis Conclave Mechanics

## Core Identity
The Neuralis Conclave represents mental dominance and psychic power, using neural networks and psionic energy to manipulate opponents, control the battlefield with thought, and outmaneuver through superior intellect.

## Key Mechanics

### Psionic Manipulation
Mental attacks that bypass physical defenses and directly target the opponent's capabilities.

**Game Impact**: Creates unique damage vectors that ignore traditional protection.

### Mind Meld
Copying, redirecting, or controlling opponent abilities and units.

**Game Impact**: Turns opponent strengths into weaknesses while adapting to any strategy.

### Collective Consciousness
Sharing knowledge and abilities across your network of units, amplifying their effectiveness.

**Game Impact**: Builds a synergistic board presence where units enhance each other's capabilities.

## Playstyle Overview

### Early Game
Develop mental network with low-cost psychic units while gathering intelligence on opponent strategy.

### Mid Game
Deploy control mechanisms to redirect opponent actions while building your card advantage through neural uplinks.

### Late Game
Execute devastating psionic attacks that scale with accumulated knowledge, or take control of opponent's most powerful units.

## Synergies

### Internal Synergies
- Multiple actions in a turn trigger additional card draw
- Psionic units amplify each other's mental attacks
- Mind meld effects can chain across multiple units

### External Synergies
- **Aeonic Dominion**: Time knowledge enhances predictive capabilities
- **Solaris Nexus**: Algorithm precision complements mental calculations
- **Umbral Eclipse**: Information warfare supports psychic control

## Counter-Strategies
- Infernal Core chaos can disrupt precise mental calculations
- Primordial Genesis primal nature can resist mental tampering
- Overwhelming multiple threats can exhaust control capacity
