# Infernal Core Mechanics

## Core Identity

The Infernal Core embodies chaotic energy and destructive power, merging demonic forces with advanced technology to create high-risk, high-reward gameplay strategies.

## Key Mechanics

### Hellfire Overclocking

Burning resources, health, or units to dramatically boost power output beyond normal limits.

**Game Impact**: Creates explosive power spikes at significant cost, enabling game-winning plays.

### Sacrifice System

Exchanging current resources or units for immediate powerful effects or summons.

**Game Impact**: Enables dramatic board swings and comeback potential when behind.

### Chaos Engine

Introducing randomized effects that can benefit Infernal Core players who build around this unpredictability.

**Game Impact**: Creates unpredictable game states that opponents struggle to plan against.

## Playstyle Overview

### Early Game

Accept initial disadvantages while setting up sacrifice engines and accumulating fuel for later explosions.

### Mid Game

Begin targeted sacrifices to disrupt opponent strategy while developing key overclocking units.

### Late Game

Unleash fully overclocked units and chaotic effects to overwhelm opponents with raw damage and unpredictable outcomes.

## Synergies

### Internal Synergies

- Units gain attack power as health diminishes
- Sacrificed units can trigger additional effects when destroyed
- Chaos effects can compound and cascade across multiple turns

### External Synergies

- **Umbral Eclipse**: Shadow manipulation complements chaos effects
- **Primordial Genesis**: Provides sustainable resources for sacrifice
- **Neuralis Conclave**: Mental abilities redirect chaotic outcomes

## Counter-Strategies

- Solaris Nexus barriers reflect amplified damage back to source
- Aeonic Dominion time manipulation can preempt overclocking timing
- Removing sacrifice outlets neutralizes key strategy components
