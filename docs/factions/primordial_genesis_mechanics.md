i think we should have a pure ai factio# Primordial Genesis Mechanics

## Core Identity
Primordial Genesis represents the fusion of nature and technology, harnessing organic evolution and titanic strength to overwhelm opponents with raw power and adaptive capabilities.

## Key Mechanics

### Adaptive Biology
Units can transform and evolve in response to environmental conditions and combat challenges.

**Game Impact**: Creates resilient units that become stronger over time and counter enemy strategies.

### Growth System
Accumulating power and size throughout the game, becoming increasingly difficult to contain.

**Game Impact**: Encourages a ramping strategy where early protection leads to unstoppable late-game entities.

### Root Network
Creating interconnected systems that share resources, healing, and strength across units.

**Game Impact**: Builds a board presence that supports itself and becomes more than the sum of its parts.

## Playstyle Overview

### Early Game
Deploy seedling units and develop resource generation structures. Focus on survival rather than early aggression.

### Mid Game
Begin adaptive transformations based on opponent strategies. Establish root networks to support key units.

### Late Game
Unleash fully-grown titans and overwhelming force, using accumulated adaptations to counter any response.

## Synergies

### Internal Synergies
- Units gain stats from other Primordial Genesis cards in play
- Adaptive traits can be shared through root networks
- Resource structures fuel rapid growth cycles

### External Synergies
- **Umbral Eclipse**: Shadow protection during vulnerable growth phases
- **Infernal Core**: Chaos energy accelerates evolution
- **Aeonic Dominion**: Time manipulation speeds growth cycles

## Counter-Strategies
- Solaris Nexus purification can reset adaptations
- Neuralis Conclave mind control can turn titans against their controller
- Targeted removal of key network nodes disrupts shared growth
