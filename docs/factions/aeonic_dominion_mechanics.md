# Aeonic Dominion Mechanics

## Core Identity
The Aeonic Dominion manipulates time and space as architects of reality, using temporal manipulation and dimensional awareness to control the flow of battle.

## Key Mechanics

### Chrono Manipulation
Altering turn sequencing, action timing, and the effective duration of abilities.

**Game Impact**: Creates a control-oriented playstyle where timing advantages decide outcomes.

### Quantum Paradox
Creating alternative timelines and scenarios that can replace or supplant current game states.

**Game Impact**: Provides tactical flexibility and the ability to "rewrite" unfavorable situations.

### Precognition
Foreseeing opponent cards and strategies before they are revealed or played.

**Game Impact**: Enables perfect counterplay and strategic positioning.

## Playstyle Overview

### Early Game
Establish temporal anchors with low-cost units while using Precognition to gain intelligence advantage.

### Mid Game
Deploy time dilation effects to slow opponent development while accelerating your own Energy and card advantage.

### Late Game
Create paradox scenarios where opponent must choose between multiple losing options, or rewind detrimental effects.

## Synergies

### Internal Synergies
- Time manipulation reduces ability costs through faction bonus
- Multiple timeline effects can stack for complex decision trees
- Temporal shields protect key units during critical phases

### External Synergies
- **Solaris Nexus**: Perfect prediction with divine algorithms
- **Neuralis Conclave**: Mental manipulation complements timeline control
- **Umbral Eclipse**: Shadow operations benefit from foreknowledge

## Counter-Strategies
- Infernal Core's chaos can disrupt timeline predictions
- Primordial Genesis adaptation counters time manipulation
- Rapid commitment strategies can resolve before paradox effects
