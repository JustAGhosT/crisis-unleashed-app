# Aeonic Dominion vs Primordial Genesis

## Core Conflict

**Controlled Evolution vs Natural Adaptation | The Evolution Paradox**

## Relationship Status

- **Cooperation**: 45% (Hostile)

- **Mechanical Bonus**: -5% damage when forced to cooperate

- **Deck Building**: Up to 15% cards from each other's faction

## Narrative Themes

### "The Selection Paradox"

A philosophical battle between those who would guide evolution and those who believe in natural selection. The Aeonic Dominion seeks to shape existence according to their grand design, while Primordial Genesis represents the untamed power of nature's relentless adaptation.

## Gameplay Interactions

### Aeonic Advantages

- **Temporal Stasis**: Can freeze Primordial's evolution counters

- **Chronal Shift**: Skips Primordial's growth phases

- **Paradox Shield**: Reduces adaptation effectiveness by 30%

### Primordial Advantages

- **Natural Immunity**: 25% resistance to time manipulation

- **Evolutionary Leap**: Can evolve out of temporal effects

- **Primal Surge**: Gains +1/+1 for each time effect used against it

## Key Matchup Mechanics

1. **Time vs Evolution**

   - Dominion's time manipulation slows Primordial's growth

   - Primordial can evolve counters to time effects

2. **Adaptation Race**

   - Primordial gains evolution counters each turn

   - Dominion must balance between disrupting growth and advancing own plans

3. **Temporal Anomalies**

   - Battles create unstable time rifts

   - Both factions can exploit these for powerful effects
