# Solaris Nexus & Primordial Genesis

## Alliance Overview

### Harmonic Evolution | The Perfect Synthesis

## Relationship Status

- **Cooperation**: 65% (Allied)

- **Mechanical Bonus**: +1 Energy regeneration per turn when controlling 3+ evolved units

- **Deck Building**: Up to 40% cards from each other's faction

## Narrative Themes

### "The Forge of Life"

A powerful union of Solaris Nexus's technological mastery and Primordial Genesis's organic evolution. Together they represent the perfect synthesis of nature and machine, where advanced technology accelerates natural evolution and organic adaptability enhances mechanical systems beyond their original design.

## Gameplay Synergies

### Combined Strengths

- **Adaptive Systems**: Evolved units gain +1 Energy regen

- **Synthetic Evolution**: Can spend Energy to accelerate unit evolution

- **Primal Circuitry**: Units with both Energy and Evolution gain +2/+2

### Shared Mechanics

1. **Evolved Reactors**

   - Energy generation increases with evolved units

   - Can store excess Energy in evolved units as +1/+1 counters

2. **Living Technology**

   - Evolved units can gain Energy-based abilities

   - Energy can be spent to trigger additional evolutions

3. **Harmonic Resonance**

   - Synergy between Energy and Evolution mechanics

   - Combined effects are stronger than individual parts

## Story Arcs

## Card Combos

### Devastating Combinations

1. **Solar Bloom** + **Evolved Reactor**

   - Create a unit that generates Energy and evolves each turn

   - Scales exponentially if left unchecked

2. **Primal Surge** + **Energy Overload**

   - Mass evolve all units, then convert excess Energy into +1/+1 counters

   - Creates an overwhelming board presence

3. **Harmonic Convergence** + **Adaptive Systems**

   - All units gain benefits from both Energy and Evolution

   - Creates a nearly unstoppable force

## Victory Conditions

### Joint Objectives

- Control 3+ evolved units with Energy abilities

- Generate 15+ Energy in a single turn

- Have 5+ units with both Energy and Evolution

### Special Win Conditions

- **Perfect Synthesis**: Create a unit with 3+ Energy and 3+ Evolutions

- **Harmonic Resonance**: Trigger 5+ Energy-Evolution interactions in one turn

- **Transcendence**: Win with 20+ combined Energy and Evolution counters

## Development Notes

- Focus on the interaction between Energy and Evolution mechanics

- Create meaningful choices between Energy spending and Evolution

- Balance around 50-53% win rate for this pairing

- Ensure the alliance feels distinct from other pairings
