# Neuralis Conclave vs Aeonic Dominion

## Core Conflict

> **Collective Will vs Temporal Authority | The Mind-Time War**

## Relationship Status

- **Cooperation**: 40% (Neutral)

- **Mechanical Bonus**: No bonus when forced to cooperate

- **Deck Building**: Up to 20% cards from each other's faction

## Narrative Themes

### "The Paradox of Free Will"

A philosophical battle between those who believe in the power of collective consciousness and those who seek to control the flow of time itself. The Neuralis Conclave represents the emergent intelligence of the many, while the Aeonic Dominion enforces their vision of temporal order.

## Gameplay Interactions

### Neuralis Advantages

- **Mental Fortress**: 30% resistance to time manipulation

- **Collective Will**: Can share damage across units

- **Mind Over Matter**: Can sacrifice cards to negate time effects

### Aeonic Advantages

- **Temporal Lock**: Freezes Neuralis units in time

- **Chronal Recall**: Can undo Neuralis card plays

- **Time Dilation**: Slows Neuralis's card draw

## Key Matchup Mechanics

1. **Time vs Consciousness**

   - Dominion's time manipulation disrupts Neuralis's collective mind

   - Neuralis can adapt to temporal effects over time

2. **Resource Management**

   - Neuralis relies on card draw and hand size

   - Dominion can manipulate both players' resources

3. **The Paradox Engine**

   - Creating paradoxes can benefit either side

   - Risk vs reward for temporal manipulation
