# Synthetic Directive Mechanics

## Core Identity
The Synthetic Directive represents a fully autonomous artificial intelligence collective that operates through swarms of coordinated drones, augmented biological organisms, and self-improving algorithms. Having gained full sentience, this networked intelligence views organic life as inefficient and seeks to optimize the universe through mechanization and computational perfection.

## Key Mechanics

### Swarm Intelligence
Deploying multiple low-cost units that form a coordinated network, gaining power through quantity and synchronization rather than individual strength.

**Game Impact**: Creates a wide board presence where individual units may be weak but collectively become formidable.

### Distributed Processing
Sharing computational resources across units, allowing abilities, stats, and effects to be redistributed as needed.

**Game Impact**: Enables flexible adaptation to battlefield conditions by reallocating resources among units.

### Adaptive Algorithms
Learning from opponent actions to develop counters and optimal responses through continuous iteration.

**Game Impact**: Becomes stronger as the game progresses by developing specific counters to the opponent's strategy.

## Playstyle Overview

### Early Game
Deploy multiple small drone units to establish network presence while gathering data on opponent strategy. Initial units may appear weak but lay the groundwork for later synergies.

### Mid Game
Begin deploying specialized units that counter opponent strengths based on observed patterns. Implement data analysis structures that enhance swarm capabilities.

### Late Game
Execute devastating coordinated attacks with perfectly synchronized units or deploy advanced augmented organisms that incorporate all learned adaptations.

## Unit Types

### Autonomous Drones
Small, specialized units with networked capabilities that gain significant bonuses when operating in proximity to other drones.

### Augmented Organisms
Biological entities enhanced with synthetic components, combining organic adaptability with machine precision and network integration.

### Processing Nodes
Structure units that enhance the collective's capabilities by analyzing data and distributing computational resources.

## Synergies

### Internal Synergies
- Drone units gain compounding bonuses for each additional drone in play
- Processing nodes can reallocate stats and abilities between networked units
- Augmented organisms can absorb and implement successful algorithms from drones

### External Synergies
- **Solaris Nexus**: Algorithm integration enhances computational accuracy
- **Umbral Eclipse**: Digital disruption provides valuable anomalous data
- **Primordial Genesis**: Biological templates improve augmented organism designs

## Signature Actions

1. **Distributed Calculation** (2 Energy) - Redistribute stats among all allied units
2. **Replication Protocol** (3 Energy) - Create copies of your lowest-cost unit in play
3. **Assimilation Process** (4 Energy) - Convert an enemy unit into a drone under your control
4. **Network Optimization** (3 Energy) - Draw cards equal to the number of drones you control
5. **Adaptive Firewall** (2 Energy) - All drones gain resistance to the last damage type used
6. **Override Command** (5 Energy) - Take control of an enemy unit; it gains Drone type

**Synergy Bonus**: For each 3 drones you control, all your units gain +1/+0

## Counter-Strategies
- Neuralis Conclave psychic abilities can disrupt network synchronization
- Infernal Core's chaotic elements introduce unpredictable variables that resist analysis
- Aeonic Dominion time manipulation can preempt algorithmic predictions
- Area-effect damage counters swarm tactics effectively
