# Faction Strategy Guide

This document provides strategic guidance and deck-building considerations for each faction in Crisis Unleashed.

## Solaris Nexus

### Core Identity & Playstyle

The Solaris Nexus faction is defined by its control-oriented playstyle, focusing on board presence, defensive structures, and late-game inevitability. Their units often feature high health and defensive keywords like **Aegis** and **Shield**, allowing them to withstand enemy assaults while building a superior board state.

### Key Mechanics & Keywords

- **Aegis:** Prevents the first instance of damage or destruction from an enemy source.
- **Shield:** Reduces incoming damage by a set amount.
- **Bless:** Positive status effect that typically provides a beneficial aura or triggers a positive effect.

### Strategic Considerations

- **Early Game:** Focus on establishing a defensive presence with units like the **Aegis Sentinel** and **Shield Warden**. Use early-game actions to control the board and slow down aggressive opponents.
- **Mid Game:** Transition to more powerful mid-range units and begin to establish board control. Use cards that generate value over time, such as **Sanctuary of Light**.
- **Late Game:** Deploy your powerful late-game threats like the **Archon of Radiance** and **Helios Titan**. By this stage, your defensive-oriented strategy should have weathered the early and mid-game, allowing you to dominate the board.

### Deck Building

- **Core Cards:**

  - **Aegis Sentinel:** A staple early-game defensive unit.
  - **Shield Warden:** Provides excellent protection for your other units.
  - **Archon of Radiance:** A powerful late-game threat with a devastating ability.

- **Synergies:**

  - Combine **Aegis** and **Shield** units to create a resilient front line.
  - Use **Bless** effects to enhance your units and create powerful combos.
