# Solaris Nexus Mechanics

## Core Identity
The Solaris Nexus represents cybernetic order, combining advanced technology with divine algorithms to maintain balance and protect the digital realm.

## Key Mechanics

### Divine Algorithms
Predictive calculations that allow Solaris units to counter or nullify specific enemy actions.

**Game Impact**: Creates a control-oriented playstyle where anticipating opponent moves is rewarded.

### Radiant Barriers
Defensive fields that can reflect damage back to attackers.

**Game Impact**: Discourages attacks and punishes aggressive strategies.

### Blessing System
Solaris units can apply beneficial effects (Bless) to allies, enhancing their capabilities.

**Game Impact**: Builds a cooperative board presence where units become stronger together.

## Playstyle Overview

### Early Game
Focus on establishing defensive positions and Energy generation. Key cards include **Halo Protocol** and low-cost barrier units.

### Mid Game
Deploy algorithm-based countermeasures and begin blessing key units. Establish Energy advantage through synergy bonuses.

### Late Game
Execute calculated counterattacks with fully enhanced units while maintaining defensive superiority.

## Synergies

### Internal Synergies
- Multiple Solaris units trigger Energy regeneration
- Blessings stack and compound on priority targets
- Barriers can create protected zones for valuable units

### External Synergies
- **Aeonic Dominion**: Time manipulation enhances predictive algorithms
- **Neuralis Conclave**: Mental abilities complement precision control
- **Primordial Genesis**: Provides sustainable resources for long-term strategies

## Counter-Strategies
- Umbral Eclipse disruption can bypass prediction systems
- Infernal Core's chaotic abilities are difficult to predict
- Rapid aggression can overwhelm before defenses are established
