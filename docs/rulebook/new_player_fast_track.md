# Crisis Unleashed - New Player Fast Track Guide

Welcome to Crisis Unleashed! This guide is designed to help you learn the essentials and start playing as quickly as possible.

## What You Need to Know in 5 Minutes

### The Core Concept

Crisis Unleashed is a competitive strategy card game where you:

- Command a unique Hero representing one of seven factions
- Deploy units in strategic positions on a 3-lane battlefield
- Cast powerful action cards to turn the tide of battle
- Adapt to ongoing Crisis events that change game conditions
- Defeat your opponent by reducing their Hero to 0 health or triggering your Ultimate Victory

### Quick Setup

1. **Choose a Faction**: Start with Solaris Nexus (control), Umbral Eclipse (stealth), or Synthetic Directive (efficiency)
2. **Select a Hero**: Each faction has multiple Heroes with unique abilities
3. **Get Your Decks**:
   - Character Deck (40 cards)
   - Action Deck (25 cards)
   - Or use a pre-built Starter Deck
4. **Set Up the Battlefield**:
   - Front, Middle, and Back lanes for each player
   - Place the Crisis deck in the neutral zone

## Core Game Mechanics

### Resource System

- **Power**: Main resource to deploy cards and activate abilities (refreshes each turn)
- **Momentum**: Special resource earned through combat (used for Hero abilities)

### Turn Structure

1. **Draw Phase**: Draw 1 Character and 1 Action card
2. **Deployment Phase**: Place Character cards on the battlefield
3. **Action Phase**: Play Action cards and activate abilities
4. **Combat Phase**: Attack with your units
5. **End Phase**: Tally Momentum and apply end-of-turn effects

### Positioning Strategy

- **Front Lane**: Best for melee units and defenders
- **Middle Lane**: Versatile positioning for balanced units
- **Back Lane**: Ideal for ranged attackers and support units

### Combat Basics

- Units can attack enemy units in the same lane
- Ranged units can attack from the Back Lane
- Combat resolves by comparing Attack values to Health
- Damaged units stay damaged until healed or removed
