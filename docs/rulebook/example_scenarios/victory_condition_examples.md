# Victory Condition Examples

## Overview

Crisis Unleashed offers multiple paths to victory. Understanding these win conditions and recognizing the key turns that lead to them is essential for strategic mastery. This document provides detailed examples of games ending through various victory conditions, showcasing decision points that lead to victory.

## Primary Victory Condition: Hero Defeat

### Example 1: Direct Combat Victory

#### Setup
- **Player A**: Controls Commander Eva (Solaris Nexus) at 12 Health
- **Player A's Board**: Solar Guardian (3/3), Radiant Sentinel (2/4)
- **Player B**: Controls Shade (Umbral Eclipse) at 5 Health
- **Player B's Board**: Shadow Assassin (4/2, Elusive), Void Servant (1/1)
- **Turn**: Player A's Combat Phase

#### Scenario Sequence

1. **Combat Assessment**:
   - Player A calculates potential damage:
     - Solar Guardian: 3 damage
     - Radiant Sentinel: 2 damage
     - Total potential damage: 5
   - Player B has Shadow Assassin with Elusive (can only be blocked by Elusive units)

2. **Decision Point**:
   - Player A has a choice:
     - Option 1: Attack with both units at Player B's hero for 5 damage (lethal)
     - Option 2: Attack Shadow Assassin with one unit to remove the threat

3. **Combat Declaration**:
   - Player A chooses Option 1, attacking directly with both units

4. **Combat Resolution**:
   - Solar Guardian and Radiant Sentinel deal a combined 5 damage
   - Player B's hero health: 5 → 0
   - Player A wins the game through the primary victory condition

**Key Takeaway**: Sometimes the correct play is to ignore enemy units and focus on dealing lethal damage to the enemy hero.

### Example 2: Spell Damage Victory

#### Setup
- **Player A**: Inferno (Infernal Core) at 7 Health
- **Player A's Hand**: Hellfire Blast (Action: "Deal 4 damage to target hero. Corrupt: Deal 6 damage instead.")
- **Player A's Board**: Corrupted Ritual (Condition: "Your Action cards gain Corrupt.")
- **Player B**: The Herald (Solaris Nexus) at 5 Health
- **Turn**: Player A's Main Phase

#### Scenario Sequence

1. **Tactical Assessment**:
   - Player A has Hellfire Blast that would normally deal 4 damage
   - Corrupted Ritual gives the Action card Corrupt, enhancing it to 6 damage

2. **Action Execution**:
   - Player A plays Hellfire Blast targeting Player B's hero
   - The Corrupt enhancement activates automatically due to Corrupted Ritual
   - Hellfire Blast deals 6 damage to Player B's hero

3. **Resolution**:
   - Player B's hero health: 5 → -1
   - Player A wins the game through the primary victory condition

**Key Takeaway**: Card enhancements and combos can create lethal damage from hand without requiring board presence.

## Alternate Victory: Deck Exhaustion

### Example: Fatigue Victory

#### Setup
- **Player A**: Chronus (Aeonic Dominion) at 15 Health
- **Player A's Deck**: 12 cards remaining
- **Player B**: Nexus Mind (Neuralis Conclave) at 10 Health
- **Player B's Deck**: 1 card remaining
- **Turn**: Player A's Main Phase

#### Scenario Sequence

1. **Strategic Assessment**:
   - Player A recognizes that Player B is almost out of cards
   - Player A has Temporal Loop (Action: "Target player draws 2 cards.")

2. **Action Execution**:
   - Player A plays Temporal Loop targeting Player B
   - Player B must draw 2 cards, but only has 1 card in deck

3. **Fatigue Resolution**:
   - Player B draws the last card from their deck
   - For the second draw, Player B's deck is empty
   - Player B takes 1 Fatigue damage (first instance of Fatigue)
   - Player B's hero health: 10 → 9

4. **Follow-Up Play**:
   - Player A plays Memory Drain (Action: "Target player draws a card.")
   - Player B must draw again with an empty deck
   - Player B takes 2 Fatigue damage (second instance of Fatigue)
   - Player B's hero health: 9 → 7

5. **Final Action**:
   - Player A plays Temporal Acceleration (Action: "Target player's start-of-turn effects trigger now.")
   - Player B's hero ability, which includes "Draw a card at the start of your turn," triggers
   - Player B must draw a third time with an empty deck
   - Player B takes 3 Fatigue damage (third instance of Fatigue)
   - Player B's hero health: 7 → 4

6. **Turn End**:
   - On Player B's next turn, they must draw for their Draw Phase
   - Player B takes 4 Fatigue damage (fourth instance)
   - Player B's hero health: 4 → 0
   - Player A wins the game by forcing Player B into fatal Fatigue damage

**Key Takeaway**: Deck exhaustion becomes increasingly dangerous as Fatigue damage accelerates with each empty draw. Forced card draw can be weaponized against opponents with few remaining cards.

## Special Card Victory Condition

### Example: Celestial Convergence Victory

#### Setup
- **Player A**: Axis (Aeonic Dominion) at 8 Health
- **Player A's Hand**: Celestial Convergence (Legendary Condition: "At the beginning of your end step, if you control cards from all 7 factions, you win the game.")
- **Player A's Board**: Units and conditions representing 6 different factions:
  - Solaris Nexus: Solar Fragment (1/1)
  - Umbral Eclipse: Shadow Remnant (1/1)
  - Aeonic Dominion: Temporal Anchor (2/2)
  - Primordial Genesis: Root Tendril (0/3)
  - Neuralis Conclave: Mind Echo (2/1)
  - Synthetic Directive: Nano Cluster (1/1)

#### Scenario Sequence

1. **Strategic Setup**:
   - Player A has spent several turns acquiring units from different factions
   - The only missing faction is Infernal Core

2. **Key Play**:
   - Player A plays Reality Splinter (Action: "Create a 1/1 unit token of your choice.")
   - Player A chooses to create an Ember Spawn (Infernal Core)
   - Player A now controls units from all 7 factions

3. **Win Condition Deployment**:
   - Player A plays Celestial Convergence (5 Energy)
   - The condition is placed on the board with its win condition check set for the end step

4. **End Phase**:
   - At the beginning of Player A's end step, Celestial Convergence's condition is checked
   - Player A controls cards from all 7 factions
   - Celestial Convergence's win condition is triggered
   - Player A wins the game immediately

**Key Takeaway**: Special card win conditions require careful setup and protection of key pieces, but allow victories regardless of life totals and board positions.

## Crisis Event Victory Condition

### Example: Quantum Collapse Victory

#### Setup
- Active Crisis Event: Quantum Collapse ("The first player to control exactly 4 units with combined power 15 or greater wins the game.")
- **Player A**: Apex (Solaris Nexus) at 14 Health
- **Player A's Board**: 3 units with combined power 11
  - Solar Titan (5/5)
  - Quantum Behemoth (4/4)
  - Light's Champion (2/3)
- **Player B**: Neural Prime (Neuralis Conclave) at 18 Health
- **Player B's Board**: 5 units with combined power 13

#### Scenario Sequence

1. **Crisis Event Assessment**:
   - Both players understand the Quantum Collapse victory condition
   - Player A needs one more unit with power 4+ to win
   - Player B has too many units (needs to get to exactly 4)

2. **Player A's Turn**:
   - Draws Nova Guardian (4/4)
   - Recognizes this would fulfill the crisis condition
   - Plays Nova Guardian
   - Board now: 4 units with power 15 (5+4+2+4)

3. **Win Condition Check**:
   - Quantum Collapse automatically checks if its condition is met
   - Player A controls exactly 4 units with combined power 15
   - The Crisis Event's victory condition is triggered
   - Player A wins the game immediately

**Key Takeaway**: Crisis Events create unique, temporary victory conditions that can result in unexpected wins. Adapting quickly to these conditions can lead to victories even when behind in the normal game state.

## Quantum Flux Victory

### Example: Reality Fracture Victory

#### Setup
- Quantum Flux Level: 9 (maximum is 10)
- Quantum Flux Effect at Level 10: "When Quantum Flux reaches 10, the player with the most units in play wins the game."
- **Player A**: The Herald (Solaris Nexus) at 5 Health
- **Player A's Board**: 7 units
- **Player B**: Shade (Umbral Eclipse) at 22 Health
- **Player B's Board**: 4 units
- **Turn**: Player A's Main Phase

#### Scenario Sequence

1. **Quantum Analysis**:
   - Player A recognizes they're losing conventionally (low health)
   - But Player A has more units (7 vs 4)
   - Quantum Flux is at 9, one away from triggering

2. **Key Decision**:
   - Player A has Reality Shift (Action: "Increase Quantum Flux by 1.")
   - Normally Player A would play defensively to survive
   - Instead, Player A plays Reality Shift

3. **Quantum Resolution**:
   - Quantum Flux increases from 9 to 10
   - The Level 10 Quantum Flux Effect triggers
   - The system checks which player has the most units
   - Player A has 7 units, Player B has 4
   - Player A wins the game through the Quantum Flux victory condition

**Key Takeaway**: Understanding alternate win conditions in the Quantum Flux system can provide victory paths even when conventional victory seems unlikely.

## Game Draw (Stalemate)

### Example: Mutual Destruction

#### Setup
- **Player A**: Inferno (Infernal Core) at 2 Health
- **Player A's Board**: Doom Harbinger (5/5, "When this unit dies, deal 3 damage to all heroes.")
- **Player B**: Axis (Aeonic Dominion) at 3 Health
- **Player B's Hand**: Reality Collapse (Action: "Destroy all units in play.")
- **Turn**: Player B's Main Phase

#### Scenario Sequence

1. **Scenario Assessment**:
   - Player B is at 3 Health, facing a 5/5 unit
   - Player A is at 2 Health
   - Player B has Reality Collapse, which would destroy all units

2. **Decision Point**:
   - Player B realizes that destroying Doom Harbinger will trigger its death effect
   - The death effect will deal 3 damage to both heroes
   - This would reduce both heroes below 0 Health

3. **Action Execution**:
   - Player B plays Reality Collapse
   - All units are destroyed, including Doom Harbinger
   - Doom Harbinger's death trigger resolves, dealing 3 damage to all heroes
   - Player A's hero: 2 Health → -1 Health
   - Player B's hero: 3 Health → 0 Health

4. **Game Resolution**:
   - Both heroes have 0 or less Health simultaneously
   - The game ends in a draw

**Key Takeaway**: Understanding when a draw might occur can be a strategic option when facing certain defeat. Sometimes forcing a draw is preferable to a loss.

## Identification of Win Conditions

### Common Signs of Approaching Victory

1. **Primary Victory (Hero Defeat)**:
   - Opponent at 5 or less Health with limited defensive options
   - Your board presents more damage than opponent's remaining Health
   - You have direct damage spells/abilities with opponent at low Health

2. **Deck Exhaustion**:
   - Opponent has 3 or fewer cards in deck
   - You have forced draw effects in hand
   - Opponent is taking increasing Fatigue damage

3. **Special Card Victory**:
   - All components for a special win condition are assembled or nearly assembled
   - You have protection for your key pieces
   - The opponent cannot disrupt your setup in one turn

4. **Crisis/Quantum Victory**:
   - Current active condition is close to being fulfilled
   - You can reach the required state in fewer moves than opponent

### Defensive Recognition

Recognizing when your opponent is approaching a win condition:

1. **Observe Patterns**: Collect specific faction cards or unusual combinations
2. **Count Resources**: Tracking remaining deck cards, Energy availability
3. **Identify Key Pieces**: Some cards telegraph specific win conditions
4. **Recognize Time Pressure**: When normal combat math doesn't explain opponent's plays

### Strategic Pivoting

Sometimes switching between win conditions is the optimal strategy:

1. **Backup Plan**: When your primary win condition is disrupted
2. **Opportunity Recognition**: When an alternate path suddenly becomes viable
3. **Misdirection**: Appearing to pursue one win condition while setting up another
