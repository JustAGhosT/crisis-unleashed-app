## Example 3: First Turn with Mulligan

### Setup, Example 3

- **Player A**: Inferno (Infernal Core)
- **Player B**: Genesis (Primordial Genesis)
- **Player A's Initial Hand**: Hellfire Imp, Brimstone, Chaos Wave, Hellfire Imp, Infernal Rage
- **Player A decides to mulligan**

### Mulligan Process

1. **Initial Assessment**:

   - Hand contains multiple 2-cost cards (Hellfire Imp, Brimstone) but no 1-cost plays
   - Lacks curve structure (too many 2-drops, no 1-drops)

2. **Mulligan Decision**:

   - Player A decides to mulligan and shuffles all 5 cards back into their deck
   - Draws 4 new cards (one fewer than starting amount): Ember Spawn, Flame Surge, Hellfire Imp, Soul Collector

3. **Post-Mulligan Assessment**:

   - New hand has a 1-cost unit (Ember Spawn) for turn 1
   - Better curve structure (1-cost, 1-cost, 2-cost, 4-cost)

### Turn Sequence, Example 3

#### Player A - Turn 1 (After Mulligan)

1. **Startup Phase**:
   - No countdown effects or start-of-turn triggers yet

2. **Draw Phase**:
   - Draws 1 card (Demonic Pact)
   - Hand size: 5 cards

3. **Energy Phase**:
   - Gains 1 Energy Crystal
   - Available Energy: 1

4. **Main Phase**:
   - Plays Ember Spawn (1 Energy)
     - Ember Spawn (1/1): "When this unit is destroyed, deal 1 damage to the enemy hero."
   - Available Energy: 0

5. **Combat Phase**:
   - No combat (first player restriction)

6. **End Phase**:
   - No end-of-turn effects yet

**Key Decision Points**:

- Player A made the correct decision to mulligan a hand with no turn 1 plays
- Secured a good curve for the first few turns
- Got a unit with potential damage even if it's removed

## Strategic Insights for First Turns

### General First Turn Principles

1. **Resource Establishment**:
   - For aggressive decks: Play a 1-cost unit to establish board presence
   - For control decks: Consider a value-generating Condition card
   - For combo decks: Play cards that filter or set up future turns

2. **Card Value Assessment**:
   - 1-cost cards that provide card selection are generally strong first plays
   - Units that generate value over time are preferred if they can survive
   - First player should focus on board development since they can't attack

3. **Faction-Specific Considerations**:
   - Solaris Nexus: Prioritize Solar units for energy advantage
   - Umbral Eclipse: Focus on evasive early units
   - Aeonic Dominion: Set up time-based effects early
   - Primordial Genesis: Establish evolving units
   - Infernal Core: Create sacrifice fodder
   - Neuralis Conclave: Establish Psychic Field connections
   - Synthetic Directive: Deploy value-generating mechanisms

4. **Turn 1 Hero Power Usage**:
   - Generally not recommended (costs momentum)
   - Exceptions: Powers that provide card selection or resource acceleration

### Common First Turn Mistakes

1. **Holding All Resources**:
   - Not playing a card on turn 1 is usually incorrect
   - Even with control decks, establishing presence is important

2. **Ignoring Future Turns**:
   - Playing the strongest 1-cost without considering turns 2-3
   - Not setting up synergies for later turns

3. **Overvaluing Card Draw**:
   - Using a card draw Action on turn 1 is rarely optimal
   - Board presence typically provides more long-term value
