## Combat Basics

1. You can attack with each of your units once per turn
2. Units can attack the opponent's hero or their units

## Winning the Game

The most common way to win is to reduce your opponent's hero to 0 Health, but some special cards and effects can provide alternate victory conditions.

## Common First-Time Questions

**Q: Can I play as many cards as I want each turn?**  
A: Yes, as long as you have enough Energy to pay for them.

**Q: Do units heal at the end of the turn?**  
A: No, damage remains until healed by an effect or the unit is destroyed.

**Q: What happens if I can't draw a card when required to?**  
A: If your deck is empty, you take Fatigue damage (1 damage the first time, increasing by 1 each subsequent time).

**Q: Can I attack my opponent's hero if they have units?**  
A: Yes, unless they have a unit with Defender, which must be attacked first.

**Q: How do I use my hero's power?**
