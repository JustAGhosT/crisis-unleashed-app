# Rulebook: Victory Conditions

## Overview

Winning a game of Crisis Unleashed can be achieved in several ways, from straightforward combat to fulfilling the requirements of reality-altering events. Understanding these conditions is crucial for forming a winning strategy and for recognizing when you are close to victory or defeat.

This document outlines all the standard and alternate victory conditions in the game.

## Primary Victory Condition: Hero Defeat

The most direct and common path to victory is to defeat the enemy hero.

- **Condition**: Reduce the opponent's Hero Health to 0 or less.
- **How it works**: A player's hero starts with a specific amount of Health. Damage from unit attacks, hero attacks, and card effects reduces this total. The moment a hero's Health reaches 0, they are defeated, and their opponent wins the game immediately. All other effects or triggers that would happen are ignored.

**Example**: Player A has their hero at 2 Health. Player B attacks the hero with a unit that has 3 Attack. Player A's hero takes the damage, their health becomes -1, and Player B wins the game instantly.

## Alternate Victory Conditions

Besides defeating the enemy hero, several other conditions can result in a win. These are less common but can be central to certain strategies.

### 1. Deck Exhaustion (Fatigue)

A player can be defeated by running out of cards in their deck.

- **Condition**: A player is forced to draw a card when their deck is empty.
- **How it works**: If a player must draw a card but has no cards left in their deck, they take Fatigue damage. The first time this happens, they take 1 damage. The second time, they take 2 damage, the third time 3, and so on. This damage increases cumulatively throughout the game. A player can lose if this Fatigue damage reduces their hero's Health to 0.

**Example**: Player A has an empty deck. At the start of their turn, during the Draw Phase, they must draw a card. They take 1 Fatigue damage. On their next turn, if they still have no deck, they will take 2 Fatigue damage.

### 2. Special Card Effects

Certain powerful cards have abilities that can win the game outright if their specific conditions are met.

- **Condition**: Fulfill the text requirement of a card that says "You win the game."
- **How it works**: These cards require complex setups and are often the centerpiece of a dedicated combo deck. The moment the conditions are met, the game ends.

**Example**: A legendary Aeonic Dominion card might read, *"If you have taken four extra turns this game, you win the game."* Fulfilling this condition would grant an instant victory.

### 3. Crisis Event Conditions

Some Crisis Events introduce unique, temporary victory conditions that are active only while the event is in play.

- **Condition**: Fulfill the unique victory condition described on the active Crisis Event card.
- **How it works**: These events fundamentally change the objective of the game for a short period. The first player to meet the event's condition wins.

**Example**: A Crisis Event card, *"Cosmic Convergence,"* might state, *"The first player to control a unit in each of the six combat lanes simultaneously wins the game."*

### 4. Quantum Flux Instability

As a game progresses, the build-up of Quantum Flux can lead to a sudden, reality-warping conclusion.

- **Condition**: A specific outcome is triggered by the Quantum Flux reaching a critical threshold.
- **How it works**: This is a rare, late-game condition. If the Quantum Flux counter reaches its maximum value (e.g., 10), a specific, pre-determined win condition might be checked.

**Example**: If the Quantum Flux reaches 10, the game rules might state that *"the player with the most cards in their hand, deck, and discard pile combined immediately wins the game."*

## Game Draw (Stalemate)

In very rare situations, a game can end in a draw. A draw occurs if:

- **Both heroes are defeated simultaneously**: If an effect deals damage to both heroes at the same time, reducing both of their Health totals to 0 or less, the game is a draw.
- **Infinite Loop**: If the game enters a state where a mandatory sequence of actions will repeat endlessly without advancing the game state or allowing either player to win, the game is declared a draw.

In casual play, a draw is simply a shared result. In competitive tournaments, specific tiebreaker rules may apply.
