## Card Frame Design

Each faction has a unique card frame design that immediately identifies its allegiance:

### Solaris Nexus
Frame features clean lines with illuminated golden circuits and holographic elements. The top of the frame displays a subtle halo motif, while the text box has a semi-transparent crystalline appearance.

### Umbral Eclipse
Frame appears to be consumed by shadow, with edges that fade and glitch. Digital distortion effects occasionally animate across the border, and the text box seems to emerge from a pool of darkness.

### Aeonic Dominion
Frame incorporates clock mechanisms and temporal streams. Small hourglasses appear in the corners, and the entire frame seems to shift slightly between different moments in time, with ghosted overlays of past and future states.

### Primordial Genesis
Frame appears partially organic, with living components that seem to grow into the art box. Root systems and crystal formations extend from the borders, and the text area resembles a cross-section of amber or plant material.

### Infernal Core
Frame appears forged in fire, with molten edges and heat-warped effects. Small flame animations occasionally dance along the borders, and the text box resembles cooled volcanic rock with glowing magma beneath.

### Neuralis Conclave
Frame features flowing neural patterns that pulse with subtle energy. Thought bubbles and psionic waves emanate from the corners, and the text area seems to float in a field of mental energy.

### Synthetic Directive
Frame has a precision-engineered appearance with modular components and data readouts. Small LED indicators appear to monitor status, and the text box resembles a high-resolution display screen with data flowing across it.

## Unit Visualization

### Solaris Nexus
Units feature sleek, advanced armor with golden-white coloration and blue energy circuits. Halos, energy shields, and precision weaponry emphasize their divine technology aesthetic. Animation focuses on smooth, calculated movements.

### Umbral Eclipse
Units emerge from or partially exist within shadow, with purple-black coloration and unpredictable form. Glitching effects, data corruption visuals, and mist-like qualities emphasize their elusive nature. Animation includes teleportation and phasing.

### Aeonic Dominion
Units exist partially across different timeframes, with teal and silver coloration featuring clockwork elements. Time crystals, hourglasses, and temporal distortion effects emphasize their chronological manipulation. Animation includes slow-motion and acceleration effects.

### Primordial Genesis
Units combine organic matter with crystalline growths, featuring green and brown coloration with amber energy. Root systems, adaptive armor, and growing/evolving components emphasize their connection to primal forces. Animation includes transformation and growth.

### Infernal Core
Units appear forged from hellfire and metal, with red and black coloration featuring molten components. Chaotic energy, sacrificial elements, and destructive machinery emphasize their risk/reward nature. Animation includes explosive effects and energy consumption.

### Neuralis Conclave
Units display floating components connected by mental energy, with violet and blue coloration featuring white psionic elements. Brain patterns, psychic waves, and consciousness visualization emphasize their mental dominance. Animation includes telepathic effects.

### Synthetic Directive
Units exhibit modular construction with networked components, featuring metallic greys and blues with red indicators. Drone swarms, data visualization, and assembly/disassembly effects emphasize their collective intelligence. Animation includes perfect synchronization between multiple units.

## Action Visualization

### Energy Visualization
Each faction has a unique way of representing energy:

- **Solaris Nexus**: Golden light that forms into precise geometric constructs
- **Umbral Eclipse**: Shadowy void energy that consumes or corrupts
- **Aeonic Dominion**: Temporal energy that distorts space-time around it
- **Primordial Genesis**: Living energy that grows and adapts organically
- **Infernal Core**: Chaotic fire energy that fluctuates in intensity
- **Neuralis Conclave**: Psionic energy that ripples like thought waves
- **Synthetic Directive**: Data energy that manifests as flowing code and network patterns

### Action Effects
Common effects have faction-specific visual interpretations:

**Damage**:
- **Solaris Nexus**: Precisely focused beams of golden light
- **Umbral Eclipse**: Corruption that spreads through the target
- **Aeonic Dominion**: Temporal decay that ages the target rapidly
- **Primordial Genesis**: Nature reclaiming through rapid growth
- **Infernal Core**: Explosive fire and chaotic energy
- **Neuralis Conclave**: Mind-shattering psionic waves

- **Synthetic Directive**: Efficient, optimized movements with parallel processes

## User Interface Elements

### Faction-Specific UI

Game interface elements adapt to the active faction:

- **Card Backs**: Prominently feature faction colors and symbols
- **Energy Counters**: Visualized according to faction energy type
- **Health Indicators**: Styled to match faction aesthetics
- **Action Buttons**: Incorporate faction textures and patterns
- **Victory/Defeat Screens**: Feature faction-appropriate celebrations or commiserations

## Implementation Guidelines

### Consistency Requirements

- Color values must adhere precisely to the specified hex codes
- Pattern elements should be used consistently across all faction materials
- Animation principles must be followed for all units and actions
- Text fonts should remain consistent within factions

### Adaptability

Visual identity should adapt across:

- Digital implementations
- Physical card designs
- Marketing materials
- User interface elements

While maintaining core recognizability and consistency.

## Cross-Faction Designs

### Multi-Faction Cards

Cards that combine multiple factions should:

1. Incorporate primary colors from all represented factions
2. Blend pattern elements in a balanced composition
3. Feature frame designs that transition between faction aesthetics
4. Include unified visual effects that reference all source factions

### Neutral Elements

Game elements without faction alignment use:

- **Primary**: Grey (#808080)
- **Secondary**: Tan (#D2B48C)
- **Accent**: Deep Blue (#00008B)
- **Pattern**: Universal constants, cosmic elements
- **Texture**: Parchment, stone, celestial energy

## Asset Creation Standards

### Resolution Requirements

- Card Art: 1024x1024 pixels minimum (300 DPI)
- Unit Models: 2048 triangles maximum (for digital implementation)
- Textures: Power of 2 dimensions (512x512, 1024x1024, etc.)
- UI Elements: Vector-based when possible, with 4K-ready raster alternatives

### File Formats

- Concept Art: PSD/PNG with preservation of layers
- Final Art: PNG for digital, CMYK TIFF for print
- 3D Models: FBX with normalized UVs
- Animations: Sprite sheets or JSON-based animation data
