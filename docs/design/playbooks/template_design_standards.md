## Design Principles

All playbook templates should adhere to these core design principles:

### Functional Priority

- Information hierarchy must prioritize gameplay-critical elements
- Templates should enhance play experience, not complicate it
- Tools should minimize calculation and tracking effort for players

### Faction Consistency

- Each faction's templates should reflect their visual identity
- Color schemes and design elements should align with faction aesthetics
- Iconography should be consistent with digital implementations

### Readability

- Text must be legible at intended print sizes (minimum 8pt for standard text)
- Critical information should be emphasized through visual hierarchy
- Contrast ratios must meet accessibility standards

### Efficiency

- Templates should be designed to minimize paper usage where possible
- Multi-function sheets preferred over single-purpose templates
- Designs should optimize ink/toner usage for home printing

## Visual Identity Guidelines

### Brand Elements

Every template must include:

- Game logo (appropriate size for template purpose)
- Faction identifier (when faction-specific)
- Template type identifier
- Version number or date

### Style Consistency

Templates must align with established game aesthetics:

- Angular, tech-inspired frames and borders
- Clean, modern layout with adequate white space
- Consistent use of established iconography
- Balanced visual weight and information density

## Layout Standards

### Standard Sizes

- Primary templates: 8.5" × 11" (US Letter)
- Strategy cards: 5" × 7"
- Reference cards: 3.5" × 5"
- Tokens and markers: 1" diameter or 1" square

### Grid System

- Templates use a 12-column grid system
- 0.25" margins minimum (0.5" recommended)
- 0.125" gutters between grid columns
- Key alignment points at 0.25" intervals

### Bleed and Safe Zone

- All full-bleed designs require 0.125" bleed area
- Critical content must remain within safe zone (0.25" from trim)
- Cut/fold lines must be clearly indicated with standard markers

## Typography Standards

### Font Hierarchy

- Headings: Quantum (custom game font), 14-24pt
- Subheadings: Quantum Medium, 12-18pt
- Body text: Proxima Nova, 8-12pt
- Data/Statistical information: Proxima Nova Mono, 8-10pt

### Font Treatment

- Avoid decorative fonts except in faction-specific decorative elements
- Limit text styles to 3 per template (e.g., regular, bold, italic)
- Maintain consistent font usage across template family
- Ensure adequate contrast between text and background (minimum 4.5:1 ratio)

## Color Specifications

### Base Template Colors

- Background: Off-white (#F7F7F7) or faction-specific dark tone
- Primary text: Dark gray (#222222) or white (#FFFFFF) on dark backgrounds
- Accent elements: Faction primary color
- Highlight elements: Faction secondary color
- Neutral elements: Cool gray (#D9D9D9)

### Faction-Specific Color Palettes

Each faction has a specific color palette for template customization:

#### Solaris Nexus

- Primary: #E9C46A (Gold)
- Secondary: #2A9CCA (Blue)
- Accent: #FFFFFF (White)
- Dark: #1A3A5A (Deep Blue)

#### Umbral Eclipse

- Primary: #6A0DAD (Deep Purple)
- Secondary: #1EAEDB (Cyan)

- Secondary: #4682B4 (Steel Blue)
- Accent: #00FF00 (Neon Green)
- Dark: #2F4F4F (Dark Slate Gray)

## Iconography Usage

### Standard Icons

- Use established game iconography for consistent representation
- Maintain minimum icon size of 12pt (4mm) for print clarity
- Use vector formats where possible for scaling without loss of quality
- Maintain consistent weight and style across icon family

### Icon Placement

- Group related icons to enhance information scanning
- Align icons consistently with text they relate to
- Use containing shapes (circles, hexagons) for better visual definition
- Ensure adequate spacing between icons (minimum 4pt)

### Color Coding

- Primary gameplay elements: Faction primary color
- Status effects: Standardized color system
  - Positive: Green (#4CAF50)
  - Negative: Red (#F44336)
  - Neutral: Blue (#2196F3)
  - Special: Purple (#9C27B0)

## Accessibility Requirements

### Visual Accessibility

- High contrast mode option for all templates (7:1 contrast ratio)
- Alternative color schemes for color vision deficiency
- Minimum text size requirements (8pt absolute minimum)
- Avoid relying solely on color to convey information

### Cognitive Accessibility

- Clear information hierarchy and grouping
- Consistent placement of recurring elements
- Explanatory text for complex mechanisms
- Visual indicators to supplement numerical data

### Print Adaptability

- Templates must be printable in grayscale without loss of usability
- Critical elements must remain functional on black and white printers
- Optimize for both color and black-and-white printing

## Digital Adaptability

### Responsive Design

- Templates should adapt to digital display when possible
- Form fields should be fillable in PDF format
- Text should reflow when displayed on diverse screen sizes
- Digital versions should maintain visual consistency with print

### Interactive Features

- Digital templates may include calculators for complex formulas
- Interactive tooltips for gameplay explanations
- Collapsible sections for reference material
- Auto-calculation for resource management where appropriate

## Template Development Process

### Design Workflow

1. **Requirement Analysis**: Define template purpose and content needs
2. **Wireframing**: Create structural layout with information hierarchy
3. **Visual Design**: Apply faction aesthetics and visual elements
4. **Prototype Testing**: Test with representative user group
5. **Refinement**: Adjust based on user feedback
6. **Format Preparation**: Create versions in all required formats
7. **Documentation**: Document template usage and relationships

### Version Control

- Templates use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Version history documented in central repository
- Template dependencies clearly documented
- Update paths defined for interrelated templates

### Quality Control Checklist

- Typography alignment and consistency
- Color accuracy in both RGB and CMYK spaces
- Information accuracy and completeness
- Bleed and registration mark correctness
- Faction-specific customization accuracy
- Accessibility compliance
- Print testing on target paper stocks
- Digital functionality testing

These standards apply to all playbook templates and should be referenced during both creation and review processes. Exceptions must be documented and approved by the design team lead.
