# Card Art Creation Process

This document outlines the process for creating card art.

## 1. Concept

The first step is to create a concept for the card art. This concept should be based on the card's mechanics and lore.

## 2. Sketch

Once the concept is approved, the artist will create a sketch of the card art. This sketch will be used to get feedback from the team.

## 3. Final Art

Once the sketch is approved, the artist will create the final card art. This art will be used in the game.
