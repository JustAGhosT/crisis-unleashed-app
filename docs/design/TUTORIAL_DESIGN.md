# Tutorial & Onboarding Design

## Learning Objectives

1. Teach core mechanics effectively
2. Introduce complexity gradually
3. Encourage strategic thinking
4. Minimize information overload

## Phased Learning Path

### Phase 1: Basic Controls (5-7 minutes)

**Focus**: Core interaction

- Card play mechanics
- Grid movement
- Basic combat resolution

### Phase 2: Core Systems (10-12 minutes)

**Focus**: Core game loops

- Energy management
- Card synergies
- Positioning basics

### Phase 3: Advanced Tactics (15-20 minutes)

**Focus**: Strategic depth

- Faction mechanics
- Advanced positioning
- Crisis events

```

### Scenario-Based Learning

1. **Defense Scenario**

   - Protect an objective
   - Teaches unit placement and zone control

2. **Race Scenario**

   - Reach a point first
   - Teaches movement and initiative

3. **Puzzle Scenario**

   - Win in one turn
   - Teaches card combos and sequencing

## Visual Design

### Tutorial UI Elements

- **Coach Character**: Faction-themed guide
- **Step Indicators**: Progress through lessons
- **Interactive Elements**: Highlighted when relevant
- **Tooltips**: Context-sensitive help

### Feedback Systems

- **Positive Reinforcement**: Visual/audio cues for correct actions
- **Gentle Correction**: Hints for mistakes
- **Progressive Hints**: Additional help if player struggles
