## General Principles

* **Consistency:** The visual hierarchy should be consistent across all screens and platforms.
* **Accessibility:** The visual hierarchy should be accessible to all users, regardless of their abilities.

## Specific Guidelines

* **Typography:** Typography can be used to create a sense of visual hierarchy. For example, larger font sizes can be used for headings and titles.
* **Layout:** Layout can be used to create a sense of visual hierarchy. For example, important elements can be placed at the top of the screen.
