# Crisis Unleashed - Comprehensive Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for Crisis Unleashed, combining the board game interface demo preparation with the new Next.js application development that includes real-time game status monitoring. The focus is on delivering a polished, engaging, and beginner-friendly experience that showcases the game's core mechanics and visual appeal.

## Design Philosophy

### Hybrid UI Approach

- **Zero-Noise Core**: Clean, minimal interface that emphasizes key information
- **Holographic Theme**: Immersive, diegetic UI elements that enhance the sci-fi experience

- **Tactical Depth**: Clear visualization of synergies and crisis events for strategic play

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed Components

- âœ… Basic Next.js application structure
- âœ… Home page with game status display
- âœ… Game status API endpoint (`/api/game-status`)
- âœ… React Query integration for data fetching

### In-Progress Components

- ðŸ”„ Faction migration (see MIGRATION_PLAN.md)
- ðŸ”„ Feature flag system

### Current State Analysis

- **Frontend**: React/TypeScript with modular components
- **Styling**: CSS Modules with global styles in index.css
- **Core Components**: Battlefield, CardHand, OpponentHand, PlayerHUD, TurnManager
- **Game State**: Managed via React state with mock data
- **Accessibility**: Basic improvements in place (e.g., ARIA labels)
