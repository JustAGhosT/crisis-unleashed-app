# Crisis Unleashed - Comprehensive Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for Crisis Unleashed, combining the board game interface demo preparation with the new Next.js application development that includes real-time game status monitoring. The focus is on delivering a polished, engaging, and beginner-friendly experience that showcases the game's core mechanics and visual appeal.

## Design Philosophy

### Hybrid UI Approach

- **Zero-Noise Core**: Clean, minimal interface that emphasizes key information
- **Holographic Theme**: Immersive, diegetic UI elements that enhance the sci-fi experience
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Advanced features revealed as players become more comfortable
- **Tactical Depth**: Clear visualization of synergies and crisis events for strategic play

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed Components

- âœ… Basic Next.js application structure
- âœ… Home page with game status display
- âœ… Game status API endpoint (`/api/game-status`)
- âœ… React Query integration for data fetching
- âœ… Feature flag system for progressive rollout
- âœ… Faction components migration (cards, grid, details)
- âœ… Card browsing components (grid, filters, details)

### In-Progress Components

- ðŸ”„ Deck Builder migration (legacy to modern implementation)
- ðŸ”„ User profile and settings integration
- ðŸ”„ Game integration systems

### Current State Analysis

- **Frontend**: React/TypeScript with modular components
- **Styling**: CSS Modules with global styles in index.css, moving to Tailwind CSS
- **Core Components**: Battlefield, CardHand, OpponentHand, PlayerHUD, TurnManager
- **Game State**: Managed via React state with mock data
- **Accessibility**: Basic improvements in place (e.g., ARIA labels)
- **Feature Flags**: System in place for gradual rollout of new features

## Deck Builder Migration Plan

### Current Status
The deck builder is being migrated from a legacy implementation to a modern component-based architecture with improved functionality:

- **Legacy System**: Basic functionality with limited card management
- **Modern System**: Enhanced UI with advanced filtering, deck statistics, and validation

### Migration Approach
1. **Parallel Implementation**: Both legacy and modern implementations available
2. **Feature Flag Control**: Toggle between implementations using `useNewDeckBuilder` flag
3. **Gradual Rollout**: Progressive enablement for user groups to gather feedback
4. **Data Compatibility**: Ensure decks created in either system are compatible

### Key Improvements
- Enhanced card display with detailed information
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Real-time deck validation and statistics
- Improved user experience with drag-and-drop functionality
- Deck sharing and exporting features
- Integration with user profiles and game systems

## Notes

- Focus on vertical slice of most engaging gameplay
- Have backup demo scenarios ready
- Prepare cheat sheet for demo presenter
- Test all hardware configurations in advance
- Prepare for offline demo capability
- Prepare answers to common technical questions
- Test the demo setup in the actual presentation environment
- Ensure the Next.js app can function independently if game interface is unavailable
- Create fallback modes for blockchain features when network is unavailable
- Use feature flags to control access to new components during development and testing
