# component-dataflow

The core game components communicate through the following data flows:

### Battlefield <-> TurnManager
- Battlefield receives current turn phase and active player from TurnManager
- TurnManager updates battlefield state when turn phase changes
- Combat resolution data flows from Battlefield to TurnManager for processing

File paths:
```
src/features/battlefield/Battlefield.tsx
src/features/battlefield/TurnManager.tsx
```

### CardHand <-> PlayerHUD 
- CardHand monitors player resources (energy, momentum) from PlayerHUD
- Playable cards are highlighted/disabled based on resource availability
- Playing a card updates resource values in PlayerHUD

File paths:
```
src/features/cards/CardHand.tsx
src/features/players/PlayerHUD.tsx
```

### GameInterface <-> Battlefield
- GameInterface renders battlefield state updates
- Unit placement/movement requests flow from GameInterface to Battlefield
- Combat animations and effects triggered by Battlefield state changes

File paths:
```
src/components/game/GameInterface.tsx 
src/features/battlefield/Battlefield.tsx
```

### TurnManager <-> PlayerHUD
- TurnManager controls resource refreshes at turn start
- PlayerHUD updates momentum and energy based on turn phase
- Hero ability activations flow from PlayerHUD to TurnManager

Key workflows:
- Turn phase transitions trigger cascading updates through components
- Resource management flows from PlayerHUD to other components
- Combat resolution involves coordination between multiple components
- State changes propagate through component hierarchy
