- Notifies unit action completion and movement results
- Sends combat resolution outcomes and zone control changes
**TurnManager → Battlefield**
- Forwards played card data and targeting information
- Receives acknowledgement of play requests and effect application results
- Updates hand state after plays resolve
- Importance Score: 80
**TurnManager → CardHand**
- Publishes current phase and priority
- Publishes resource/momentum availability for play highlighting
2. TurnManager (with PlayerHUD display) verifies and deducts resources
4. Apply card effects to game state (Battlefield or other zones as applicable)

The core game components maintain the following data flows:

1. **Battlefield → TurnManager**
- Sends unit position updates and combat events
- Notifies when units enter/exit combat zones 
- Reports battlefield state changes for turn validation
- Files: `frontend/src/features/battlefield/Battlefield.tsx`, `frontend/src/features/battlefield/TurnManager.tsx`

2. **CardHand → GameInterface**
- Emits card play events with targeting data
- Updates hand state after card resolution
- Tracks energy/momentum costs for played cards
- Files: `frontend/src/features/cards/CardHand.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/game/GameInterface.tsx`

3. **TurnManager → PlayerHUD**
- Broadcasts turn phase changes
- Updates resource pools at phase transitions
- Sends ability activation notifications
- Files: `frontend/src/features/battlefield/TurnManager.tsx`, `frontend/src/features/players/PlayerHUD.tsx`

4. **GameInterface → All Components**
- Maintains global game state
- Dispatches game events to relevant components
- Coordinates cross-component interactions
- Synchronizes UI updates across components
- Files: `frontend/src/components/game/GameInterface.tsx`

5. **PlayerHUD → CardHand**
- Provides resource availability for card validation
- Signals when abilities are ready/disabled
- Updates targeting options based on state
- Files: `frontend/src/features/players/PlayerHUD.tsx`, `frontend/src/features/cards/CardHand.tsx`

Core data updates follow this flow:
1. Component emits state change
2. GameInterface validates and processes 
3. TurnManager checks turn/phase rules
4. State updates propagate to affected components
5. UI synchronizes across all components

Critical state managed includes:
- Unit positions and combat status
- Card hand and deck states
- Resource pools (Energy/Health/Momentum)
- Turn phases and active player
- Targeting and ability states
- Combat resolution state
