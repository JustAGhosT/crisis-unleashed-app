# component-dataflow

The game components maintain the following key data flows:

### Battlefield <-> TurnManager
- Battlefield subscribes to turn phase changes from TurnManager
- Updates unit placement/movement permissions based on current turn phase
- Notifies TurnManager when unit actions are completed
- Receives zone control updates affecting valid unit placements

### CardHand <-> TurnManager 
- Receives turn phase to determine playable cards
- Validates card plays based on current energy/momentum from TurnManager
- Notifies TurnManager when cards are played for resource deduction
- Updates hand state when TurnManager signals phase transitions

### GameInterface <-> PlayerHUD
- Passes player resource updates (health/energy/momentum)
- Receives player action selections and validates against current resources
- Updates crisis event status and impacts on player resources
- Synchronizes battlefield state changes to HUD display

### PlayerHUD <-> TurnManager
- Subscribes to phase changes to update available actions
- Validates resource costs against current player pools
- Signals resource changes after actions resolve
- Maintains turn timer state from TurnManager

Key State Updates:
- Turn phases trigger cascading updates across all components
- Resource changes (energy/momentum) affect valid actions
- Unit placement/movement updates battlefield control zones
- Card plays modify hand state and trigger resource updates
- Crisis events impact multiple component states simultaneously
