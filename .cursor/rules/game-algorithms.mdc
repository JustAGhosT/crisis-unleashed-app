## Core Game Systems

### Turn Structure and Resource Management
- **Draw Phase**: Players draw until reaching hand size limit
- **Energy Phase**: Energy resets to maximum (10) plus modifiers
- **Main Phase**: Players can deploy units, structures, and actions
- **Combat Phase**: Combat resolution using initiative-based sequencing
- **End Phase**: Effects resolve, momentum accumulates, crisis events trigger

### Battlefield Management
- Hexagonal grid system with 3 zones:
  - Frontline (units engage in direct combat)
  - Support (ranged units and structures)
  - Reserve (protected reinforcement zone)
- Zone control mechanics affect resource generation and card abilities
- Line of sight calculations for ranged combat and abilities

### Combat Resolution
- Initiative order determines unit activation sequence
- Attack resolution includes:
  - Base damage + modifiers
  - Faction-specific combat abilities
  - Zone control bonuses
  - Structure effects
  - Crisis event modifiers

### Card Deployment Logic
- Resource cost validation (Energy/Momentum)
- Zone placement restrictions
- Faction alignment requirements
- Synergy calculations between allied units
- Crisis event impact assessment

### Crisis Integration System
- Dynamic events affect battlefield conditions
- Zone control modifiers during crisis
- Resource generation changes
- Special combat rules during events
