## Core Systems

### Turn Sequence Engine
- Phase-based turn management system:
  - Draw Phase: Card drawing and resource regeneration
  - Energy Phase: Energy point allocation 
  - Main Phase: Card playing and ability activation
  - Combat Phase: Attack declaration and resolution
  - End Phase: Cleanup and effect resolution

### Combat Resolution System
- Initiative-based combat using unit stats and positioning
- Multi-zone battlefield grid with specialized areas:
  - Frontline/Backline zones
  - Faction-specific territory bonuses
  - Strategic control points
- Simultaneous damage resolution with priority ordering

### Resource Management
- Dual resource system:
  - Energy: Primary resource for playing cards and abilities
  - Momentum: Secondary resource gained through combat/actions
- Progressive scaling with turn count
- Faction-specific resource modifiers

### Card Deployment Logic
- Position validation based on:
  - Zone restrictions (frontline/backline)
  - Adjacency rules
  - Faction territory requirements
- Unit type restrictions:
  - Heroes limited to 1 per deck
  - Regular units max 3 copies
  - Structure placement rules

## Faction Mechanics

### Faction-Specific Algorithms
- Solaris: Energy manipulation and prediction systems
- Umbral: Stealth and information warfare mechanics
- Neuralis: Mind control and psychological warfare
- Aeonic: Time manipulation effects
- Infernal: Sacrifice and power transfer systems
- Primordial: Evolution and adaptation mechanics
- Synthetic: Optimization and efficiency algorithms

### Synergy System
- Inter-faction ability combinations
- Power scaling based on faction alignment
- Territory control bonuses
- Resource sharing mechanics

## Crisis Event System
- Dynamic event generation
- Multi-faction impact calculations
- Territorial control modifications
- Resource distribution algorithms
