## Core Game Systems

### Turn Management (80/100)
- Three-phase turn structure: Deploy, Action, End 
- Resource accumulation/spending system per phase
- Automated phase progression with timer
- Phase-specific action validation
- Located in: `/frontend/src/features/battlefield/TurnManager.tsx`

### Battlefield Management (85/100)
- Zone-based control system with distinct areas:
  - Player territories
  - Enemy zones  
  - Neutral contested spaces
  - Strategic frontline/backline positions
- Unit placement validation based on zone type
- Combat positioning mechanics
- Located in: `/frontend/src/features/battlefield/Battlefield.tsx`

### Combat Resolution (90/100)
- Initiative-based attack sequencing
- Simultaneous damage resolution
- Status effect application/removal
- Unit destruction processing
- Combat keywords: Quick Attack, Overwhelm, Lifesteal, Shield

### Card System (95/100)
- Complex card hierarchy:
  - Hero cards with unique abilities
  - Unit cards (melee, ranged, siege, flying)
  - Action cards (instant, ongoing, equipment)
  - Structure cards (buildings, traps, auras)
- Energy cost validation
- Play condition verification
- Synergy detection between card types

### Resource Management (75/100)
- Energy system with 10-point cap
- Momentum accumulation up to 5 points
- Resource gain/spend tracking
- Hero ability activation costs
- Located in: `/frontend/src/features/players/PlayerHUD.tsx`

### Faction Mechanics (95/100)
Unique systems per faction:
- Solaris: Energy manipulation
- Umbral: Stealth and information warfare
- Neuralis: Mind control mechanics
- Aeonic: Time manipulation
- Primordial: Growth and adaptation
- Infernal: Sacrifice mechanics

Located in faction-specific files under `/frontend/src/components/factions/`

### Crisis Events (85/100)
- Event trigger conditions
- Impact calculation
- Countdown mechanics
- Resolution requirements
- Reward distribution
- Located in: `/frontend/src/components/CrisisEvent.tsx`
