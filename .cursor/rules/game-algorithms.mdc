## Core Combat System
**Importance Score: 95**
- Implements zone-based tactical combat with unit placement rules
- Manages battlefield grid layout and positioning
- Handles line-of-sight calculations and range restrictions
- Resolves combat interactions between units including timing and initiative
- Processes status effects, buffs, and zone control mechanics

## Turn Sequence Management 
**Importance Score: 90**
- Implements distinct turn phases: Draw, Energy, Main, Combat, End
- Manages resource resets (energy/momentum) between phases
- Handles phase-specific actions and timing restrictions
- Controls turn transitions with faction-specific modifications

## Card Deployment Logic
**Importance Score: 85**
- Validates card play conditions including energy costs and timing
- Implements targeting system for card abilities and effects
- Manages card counters for deck, hand and discard piles
- Processes mulligan system and card draw mechanics

## Crisis Event System
**Importance Score: 80**
- Implements dynamic crisis events that modify gameplay
- Manages crisis resolution mechanics and rewards
- Controls timing of crisis activation and effects
- Handles interaction between crisis events and battlefield state

## Synergy System
**Importance Score: 75**
- Calculates potential card synergies and combo effects
- Manages activation conditions for synergy bonuses
- Tracks synergy chains and multipliers
- Implements faction-specific synergy mechanics

## Resource Management
**Importance Score: 70**
- Controls three-resource system: Health, Energy, Momentum
- Implements resource generation and consumption rules
- Handles faction-specific resource modifiers
- Manages resource overflow and minimum thresholds
