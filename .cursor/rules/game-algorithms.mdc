Core Game Systems:

1. Turn Sequencing Engine
- Enforced phase ordering:
  - Draw Phase 
  - Energy Phase (Resource regeneration)
  - Main Phase (Card deployment)
  - Combat Phase (Attack resolution)
  - End Phase
- Energy regeneration rules between turns
- Phase-specific action validation

2. Combat Resolution System
- Unit positioning on hexagonal grid
- Attack priority calculation based on unit types
- Combat damage resolution with faction modifiers
- Terrain effect application during combat

3. Faction Ability Processing
- Unique faction power activation:
  - Solaris: Predictive algorithm enhancement
  - Umbral: Information warfare mechanics 
  - Aeonic: Time manipulation effects
  - Others defined but not detailed
- Cross-faction interaction rules
- Ability timing validation

4. Card Deployment Logic
- Placement validity checking based on:
  - Unit type restrictions
  - Terrain compatibility
  - Faction requirements
  - Resource availability
- Chain reaction triggers for card effects

5. Resource Management
- Multi-resource economy:
  - Energy points 
  - Momentum generation
  - Crisis event tokens
- Resource conversion rules
- Faction-specific resource modifiers

6. Crisis Event System
- Dynamic battlefield modifiers
- Event trigger conditions
- Resolution pathways
- Reward distribution logic

7. Synergy Detection
- Card combo identification
- Cross-faction power amplification
- Data-Link activation requirements
- Chain effect resolution
