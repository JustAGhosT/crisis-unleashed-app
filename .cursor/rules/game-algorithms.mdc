# game-algorithms

The key game algorithms center around three core systems:

## Battlefield Management (Importance: 95)
Located in `frontend/src/components/Battlefield.ts`
- 3D grid-based battlefield implementation for unit deployment
- Position-based combat resolution between units
- Handles unit placement validation and movement restrictions
- Visual state management for unit selection and targeting

## Card Deployment Logic (Importance: 90) 
Located in `frontend/src/components/CardHand.ts`
- Card selection and deployment validation
- Energy cost verification for card plays
- Card availability checks based on game state
- Handles card rarity and special ability triggers

## Turn Sequencing (Importance: 85)
Located in `frontend/src/components/TurnManager.js`
- Phase-based turn management
- Player action validation per phase
- Turn transition handling with state updates
- End-of-turn effect resolution

## Combat Resolution (Importance: 80)
Located in `frontend/src/components/GameInterface.js`
- Unit combat calculations and damage resolution
- Health/stat tracking for units in combat
- Battlefield position impact on combat outcomes
- Special ability triggers during combat phases

The game algorithms operate on a phase-based system:
1. Draw Phase - Card draw and resource refresh
2. Main Phase - Card deployment and unit movement
3. Combat Phase - Attack declaration and damage resolution
4. End Phase - Cleanup and state updates
