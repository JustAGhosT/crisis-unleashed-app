## Core Battle System
**Importance: 95**
- Hex-based battlefield with distinct zones (frontline, backline, neutral)
- Zone of control (ZOC) mechanics affect unit movement and positioning
- Custom movement costs based on unit type and terrain
- Battlefield zone restrictions enforce positioning rules
- Combat sequencing through initiative-based system

## Turn Management 
**Importance: 90**
- Phase-based turn structure:
  - Draw Phase: Card draw mechanics and resource gain
  - Energy Phase: Energy allocation and momentum generation
  - Main Phase: Card deployment and ability activation
  - Combat Phase: Initiative-based attack resolution
  - End Phase: Cleanup and effect resolution
- Resource systems track Energy and Momentum
- Phase-specific action validation and restrictions

## Card Deployment Logic
**Importance: 85**
- Zone-specific placement rules per card type
- Energy cost validation against available resources
- Placement validation based on battlefield control
- Chain reaction system for simultaneous effects
- Unit type placement restrictions (melee frontline only, etc)

## Combat Resolution
**Importance: 90**
- Initiative-based combat sequence
- Attack range validation per unit type
- Line of sight calculations on hex grid
- Simultaneous damage resolution system
- Status effect application order
- Counter-attack mechanics based on unit position

## Faction Mechanics 
**Importance: 88**
- Unique faction abilities modify base game rules:
  - Energy Manipulation alters resource generation
  - Stealth bypasses standard targeting rules
  - Time Manipulation affects turn sequencing
  - Growth adapts unit stats over time
  - Sacrifice provides power at resource cost
  - Mind Control temporarily claims enemy units

## Status Effect System
**Importance: 82**
- Effect stacking rules and limitations
- Duration tracking across turn phases
- Effect precedence and override rules
- Conditional trigger system for effects
- Buff/debuff interaction resolution
