# === USER INSTRUCTIONS ===
- Axial coordinate system for hex positioning (q,r coordinates)
- Neighbor calculation and pathfinding algorithms
- Line of sight and range calculations based on hex distance
- Implementation split between:
  - `frontend-next/src/types/grid.ts` - Core grid model and utilities
  - `frontend-next/src/features/battlefield/Battlefield.tsx` - UI representation
- Turn structure with distinct phases:
  - Draw Phase: Card drawing and start-of-turn effects
  - Energy Phase: Resource generation and allocation
  - Main Phase: Card playing and unit activation
  - Combat Phase: Attack declaration and resolution
  - End Phase: End-of-turn effects and cleanup
- State machine implementation with:
  - Defined states for each game phase
  - Valid transitions between states with guard conditions
  - Side effects triggered by transitions
  - Faction-specific modifiers to transition rules
- Crisis event system that can modify state machine rules
- Implementation split between:
  - `frontend-next/src/types/state/GameStateMachine.ts` - Core state machine model
  - `frontend-next/src/features/battlefield/TurnManager.tsx` - UI orchestrator
- Synergy detection using directed graph of card interactions
- Tag-based matching system for identifying potential synergies
- Multi-level synergy classification (basic, advanced, expert)
- Chain reaction mechanics with:
  - Cycle detection to prevent infinite loops
  - Maximum chain depth limits for performance
  - Fallback resolution for conflicting synergy effects
- Faction-specific synergy modifiers and amplifiers
- Implementation split between:
  - `frontend-next/src/services/synergy/SynergyDetector.ts` - Core detection algorithm
  - `frontend-next/src/services/synergy/ChainResolver.ts` - Chain reaction processing
  - `frontend-next/src/services/synergy/SynergyRules.ts` - Synergy definitions and rules

## Core Game Entities

### Card Model (90/100)
`frontend-next/src/types/card.ts`
- Type definitions for game cards with properties:
  - Faction affiliation and energy cost
  - Attack/health values 
  - Keywords and abilities
  - Zone placement restrictions
  - Initiative value for combat sequencing
  - Special effects and triggers

### Battlefield Grid (85/100) 
`frontend-next/src/components/game/Battlefield.tsx`
- Hex-based grid system with:
  - Three distinct zones (frontline, backline, reserves)
  - Unit positioning rules and movement costs
  - Zone control mechanics
  - Range calculation for abilities and attacks
  - Terrain effects on unit stats

### Player Stats (80/100)
`frontend-next/src/types/game.ts`
- Core player resources:
  - Health (0-30)
  - Energy (accumulates each turn)
  - Momentum (builds through actions)
  - Hand size limits
  - Deck composition stats

### Combat Resolution (85/100)
`frontend-next/src/lib/card-utils.ts`
- Initiative-based combat sequence
- Damage calculation including:
  - Base damage modified by effects
  - Armor reduction
  - Penetration calculations 
  - Overkill damage rules
  - Death resolution order

### Faction Mechanics (90/100)
`frontend-next/src/types/faction.ts`
- Unique faction abilities:
  - Energy manipulation
  - Stealth mechanics
  - Time distortion
  - Growth acceleration
  - Mind control
  - Sacrifice benefits
  - Synthetic evolution

### Resource Systems (75/100)
- Energy Management:
  - Base gain of 1 per turn
  - Maximum energy cap of 10
  - Faction-specific modifiers
- Momentum Accumulation:
  - Generated through specific card plays
  - Spent on powerful effects
  - Decay mechanics between turns
