description: Defines core game entities and data models for cards, battlefield grid, player stats, and game state
---

# === USER INSTRUCTIONS ===
- Axial coordinate system for hex positioning (q,r coordinates)
- Neighbor calculation and pathfinding algorithms
- Line of sight and range calculations based on hex distance
- Implementation split between:
  - `frontend-next/src/types/grid.ts` - Core grid model and utilities
  - `frontend-next/src/features/battlefield/Battlefield.tsx` - UI representation
- Turn structure with distinct phases:
  - Draw Phase: Card drawing and start-of-turn effects
  - Energy Phase: Resource generation and allocation
  - Main Phase: Card playing and unit activation
  - Combat Phase: Attack declaration and resolution
  - End Phase: End-of-turn effects and cleanup
- State machine implementation with:
  - Defined states for each game phase
  - Valid transitions between states with guard conditions
  - Side effects triggered by transitions
  - Faction-specific modifiers to transition rules
- Crisis event system that can modify state machine rules
- Implementation split between:
  - `frontend-next/src/types/state/GameStateMachine.ts` - Core state machine model
  - `frontend-next/src/features/battlefield/TurnManager.tsx` - UI orchestrator
- Synergy detection using directed graph of card interactions
- Tag-based matching system for identifying potential synergies
- Multi-level synergy classification (basic, advanced, expert)
- Chain reaction mechanics with:
  - Cycle detection to prevent infinite loops
  - Maximum chain depth limits for performance
  - Fallback resolution for conflicting synergy effects
- Faction-specific synergy modifiers and amplifiers
- Implementation split between:
  - `frontend-next/src/services/synergy/SynergyDetector.ts` - Core detection algorithm
  - `frontend-next/src/services/synergy/ChainResolver.ts` - Chain reaction processing
  - `frontend-next/src/services/synergy/SynergyRules.ts` - Synergy definitions and rules
