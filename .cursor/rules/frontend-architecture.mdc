## Component Hierarchy

### Core Game Components
- `GameInterface`: Orchestrates the main game flow and integrates battlefield, hands, and HUD
- `Battlefield`: Manages zone-based unit placement and combat resolution across frontline/backline areas
- `TurnManager`: Controls the three-phase turn system (Deploy, Action, End) with resource management
- `CardHand`: Handles card play validation, energy costs, and hand size limits

### Faction-Specific Components
- `FactionPortal`: Entry point for faction selection and management
- `FactionCard`: Displays faction-specific information and abilities
- `FactionHexagon`: Visual representation of faction relationships and alignments
- Individual faction pages (`SolarisPage`, `UmbralPage`, etc.) implementing unique faction mechanics

### State Management
- Context-based theme management via `FactionThemesContext`
- Game state handling through component-level state for:
  - Turn phases
  - Resource tracking (Energy, Momentum)
  - Card hands and battlefield positions
  - Crisis events

### UI/UX Patterns
1. Mood Board System
- `MoodBoard`: Base component for faction-specific visual themes
- Specialized implementations (`SolarisMoodBoard`, `UmbralMoodBoard`)
- Dynamic theming based on faction alignment

2. Player Interface
- `PlayerHUD`: Manages and displays player resources
- `OpponentHand`: Shows opponent card count and play animations
- Visual feedback for valid/invalid actions

3. Battlefield Layout
- Zone-based grid system for unit placement
- Distinct visual areas for player/enemy territories
- Combat position indicators and movement paths

4. Card Management
- Card type visualization (Character, Action, Upgrade)
- Rarity display system
- Ability and effect animations

## Integration Points

1. Timeline System
- Displays faction emergence events
- Shows branching paths (Integration, Collapse, Divergence)
- Crisis event visualization

2. Resource System
- Triple resource tracking (Health, Energy, Momentum)
- Faction-specific resource mechanics
- Visual resource state indicators
