### Component Hierarchy

1. **Game Core Components**
- Root game provider managing global state and faction themes
- Battle system components for tactical grid-based gameplay 
- Resource management system tracking Energy, Momentum, and Health
- Turn phase controller managing Draw, Energy, Main, Combat, End phases

2. **Deck Building System** 
Importance Score: 95
```
DeckBuilder/
  ├── DeckStats (cost curve, faction balance)
  ├── DeckList (card organization) 
  ├── CardCollection (available cards)
  └── CardFilters (faction/type/cost filters)
```

3. **Faction System Components**
Importance Score: 90
```
Factions/
  ├── FactionGrid (hexagonal layout)
  ├── FactionCard (individual display)
  ├── ConnectionLines (faction relationships)
  └── MoodBoard (faction themes/aesthetics)
```

4. **Card Game Interface**
Importance Score: 85
```
GameInterface/
  ├── Battlefield (tactical grid)
  ├── PlayerHUD (resources/stats)
  ├── CardHand (held cards)
  └── TurnManager (phase control)
```

### State Management

1. **Game State** 
Importance Score: 90

- Tracks faction limitations
- Manages card collection and filters
- Provides deck statistics and recommendations

3. **Faction Portal State**
Importance Score: 80
- Controls faction theme switching
- Manages faction relationship displays
- Handles timeline and program progression
- Tracks technological synthesis state

### UI/UX Implementation

1. **Holographic Interface System**
Importance Score: 85
- Faction-specific color schemes and effects
- Dynamic grid overlays and glow effects
- Responsive energy/momentum visualizations
- Tactical grid highlight system

2. **Card Interaction System**
Importance Score: 80
- Drag and drop card placement
- Targeting system for abilities
- Resource cost validation
- Card preview and detail display
