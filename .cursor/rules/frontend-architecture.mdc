description: Defines frontend React architecture, component hierarchy, and state management for a faction-based card game

# === USER INSTRUCTIONS ===
- Game Layout: `frontend-next/src/components/game/GameInterface.tsx`
- Faction-Based Theming: `frontend-next/src/context/FactionThemesContext.tsx`
- Card Management: `frontend-next/src/features/cards/CardHand.tsx`
- Battlefield Grid: `frontend-next/src/features/battlefield/Battlefield.tsx`
- Resource Display: `frontend-next/src/features/players/PlayerHUD.tsx` 
- Faction Selection: `frontend-next/src/components/factions/FactionGrid.tsx`
- Turn Manager: `frontend-next/src/features/battlefield/TurnManager.tsx`

  - GameInterface emits phase changes; TurnManager controls sequencing
  - CardHand derives playable state from current phase and resources
  - PlayerHUD subscribes to resource updates and action outcomes
Dataflow:
 - GameInterface -> PlayerHUD: resource and status updates
 - CardHand -> TurnManager: play requests validated vs energy/momentum
 - TurnManager -> CardHand: phase transitions affect playable cards
 - Battlefield <-> PlayerHUD: unit placements update control zones and HUD
- Drag and drop card placement (standardize on dnd-kit)
- Targeting system for abilities
- Resource cost validation
- Card preview and detail display
- Input support: mouse, touch, keyboard (focus + ARIA)
- Hit-testing: grid cell snapping and valid-target highlighting rules

## Core Architecture Components

### Faction System (90/100)
`frontend-next/src/lib/theme/faction-theme.ts`
- Implements faction-specific theming and visual identity system
- Manages dynamic color palettes and style variants per faction
- Controls faction-based component rendering rules
- Handles faction relationship mapping and compatibility

### Deck Building Engine (85/100)  
`frontend-next/src/components/deck-builder/DeckBuilder.tsx`
- Enforces deck construction rules:
  - Maximum 3 copies per card
  - 30-50 cards per deck
  - Maximum 2 compatible factions
- Validates energy curves and faction synergies
- Handles deck import/export with versioning

### Game State Management (80/100)
`frontend-next/src/lib/deck-builder/deck-builder-context.tsx`
- Manages complex game state including:
  - Player resources (energy, momentum)
  - Card zones and positioning 
  - Turn phases and action timing
  - Combat resolution queue
- Implements state persistence and synchronization

### Card Interaction System (75/100)
`frontend-next/src/components/cards/GameCard.tsx`
- Handles card targeting and validation
- Manages energy costs and requirements
- Controls card zone restrictions
- Implements card effect resolution

### Feature Flag Control (70/100)
`frontend-next/src/lib/feature-flags/feature-flag-provider.tsx`
- Controls feature availability per faction
- Manages progressive feature rollout
- Handles faction-specific feature gates
- Synchronizes feature state across components

### Authentication Integration (65/100)
`frontend-next/src/lib/auth/AuthContext.tsx`
- Manages faction-specific permissions
- Controls deck sharing and visibility
- Handles user progression systems
- Manages collection restrictions
