# frontend-architecture

## Core Component Structure
- Game Layout: `frontend/components/game/GameInterface.tsx`
  - Battlefield Grid: Controls zone placement and unit positioning
  - Resource Management: Tracks energy/momentum across turn phases  
  - Player Areas: Defines card hand and hero placement zones
  - Combat Resolution: Manages attack targeting and damage resolution

## State Management 
- Faction-Based Theming: `frontend/context/FactionThemesContext.tsx`
  - Dynamic theme switching based on active faction
  - Custom styling per faction: colors, gradients, fonts
  - Shared theme tokens for consistent faction identity

- Card Management: `frontend/features/cards/CardHand.tsx`
  - Hand size limits and draw mechanics
  - Energy cost validation for card plays
  - Combat keyword resolution (Quick Attack, Overwhelm, etc)
  - Zone placement restrictions

## UI/UX Implementation
- Battlefield Grid: `frontend/features/battlefield/Battlefield.tsx`
  - Frontline/Backline zone system
  - Unit positioning constraints
  - Attack vector visualization
  - Zone control indicators

- Resource Display: `frontend/features/players/PlayerHUD.tsx` 
  - Energy/Momentum tracking
  - Turn phase indicators
  - Combat stats visualization
  - Hero power availability

- Faction Selection: `frontend/components/factions/FactionGrid.tsx`
  - Dynamic faction emblem loading
  - Faction synergy visualization
  - Technology tree connections
  - Ability preview system

## Game Flow Control
- Turn Manager: `frontend/features/battlefield/TurnManager.tsx`
  - Phase sequencing logic
  - Action point allocation
  - Combat resolution queuing
  - Resource regeneration rules

The architecture emphasizes faction-specific theming and mechanics while maintaining a consistent game flow across different faction combinations. Core systems like resource management and combat resolution are designed to be extensible for future faction additions.
