# frontend-architecture

The frontend architecture implements specialized game logic through a component hierarchy focused on faction interactions and progressive feature deployment.

## Core Component Architecture

### Feature Flag System
- Dynamic feature flag provider enables gradual rollout of new features
- Admin interface toggles flags for A/B testing and staged releases
- Middleware routes users between legacy and new implementations
- File paths:
  - `src/lib/feature-flags/feature-flag-provider.tsx`
  - `src/app/admin/feature-flags/page.tsx`
  - `src/middleware.ts`

### Faction System Components
- FactionGridWrapper conditionally renders new/legacy faction grids
- Custom data transformations map old faction structure to new schema
- Specialized faction detail pages with dynamic routing
- File paths:
  - `src/components/factions/FactionGridWrapper.tsx`
  - `src/app/factions/[id]/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/factions/page.tsx`

### Theme Management
- Custom theme provider with light/dark/system modes
- Faction-specific color themes and styling
- Theme persistence across sessions
- File paths:
  - `src/components/theme-provider.tsx`
  - `src/components/theme-toggle.tsx`

## Migration Architecture

### Component Migration Strategy
- Incremental migration from Vite to Next.js
- Feature flags control deployment of new components
- Legacy compatibility layer during transition
- Type adapters ensure data consistency
- File paths:
  - `src/MIGRATION.md`
  - `src/MIGRATION_PLAN.md`
  - `src/components/legacy/README.md`

### Faction Data Models
- Detailed specifications for six unique factions
- Each faction has distinct themes and mechanics
- Custom validation for faction IDs in static generation
- File paths:
  - `.neuralliquid-ai/FACTION_SYSTEM.md`
  - `src/lib/data.ts`
