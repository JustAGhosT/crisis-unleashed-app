## Component Hierarchy

Core Game Components:
- FactionPortal (`/frontend/src/FactionPortal.tsx`)
  - Manages faction selection and interaction flows
  - Implements faction relationship visualization through hex grid
  - Handles faction-specific visual treatments and animations

- Battlefield (`/frontend/src/features/battlefield/Battlefield.tsx`)
  - Grid-based combat zone with specialized territory markers
  - Dynamic resource display tied to faction mechanics
  - Implements turn phase system with faction-specific modifiers

- GameInterface (`/frontend/src/components/game/GameInterface.tsx`)
  - Coordinates cross-faction ability interactions
  - Manages state for dual resource system (Energy/Momentum)
  - Handles crisis event triggers and resolution

## State Management

Faction State:
- FactionThemesContext (`/frontend/src/context/FactionThemesContext.tsx`)
  - Maintains active faction visual identities
  - Coordinates cross-faction synergy effects
  - Manages faction-specific resource modifiers

Game State:
- TurnManager (`/frontend/src/features/battlefield/TurnManager.tsx`)
  - Tracks phase progression
  - Manages crisis countdown system
  - Updates resource pools based on faction abilities

Component Integration:
- MoodBoard System (`/frontend/src/components/factions/MoodBoard.tsx`)
  - Faction-specific visual language coordination
  - Dynamic theme application based on faction combinations
  - Handles faction power manifestation effects

The architecture emphasizes faction identity preservation while enabling complex inter-faction mechanics through a modular component system. Each faction maintains distinct visual and mechanical characteristics while supporting cross-faction synergies.
