## Project Overview

Crisis Unleashed is a digital card game with blockchain integration, featuring seven unique factions with distinct mechanics. This document consolidates all planning and migration efforts into a single source of truth.

## Design Philosophy

### Hybrid UI Approach

- **Zero-Noise Core**: Clean, minimal interface emphasizing key information
- **Holographic Theme**: Immersive UI elements enhancing the sci-fi experience
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Advanced features revealed as players become comfortable
- **Tactical Depth**: Clear visualization of synergies and crisis events

## Implementation Status

### Completed Components

- âœ… Basic Next.js application structure
- âœ… React Query integration
- âœ… Feature flag system
- âœ… Core UI components (Button, Card, Badge, Alert)
- âœ… Faction system migration (cards, grid, details)
- âœ… Card browsing components
- âœ… Basic layout components
- âœ… Type-check baseline clean (frontend-next)
- âœ… Deck builder core UI (grid, list)

### In Progress

- [ ] Chat system
- [ ] Friend system

## Migration Strategy

### Completed Migrations

- Faction components to Next.js
- Core UI components to shadcn/ui
- State management to React Query
- Deck builder core UI (grid, list)

### Pending Migrations

#### 1. Deck Builder Interface

- [ ] **UI Components**
  - [x] Create card grid with filtering and search
  - [x] Implement deck list management
  - [x] Add card details panel
    - Acceptance criteria:
      - [x] Shows name, type, faction, rarity badge, cost, description, and image when available.
      - [x] Displays combat stats and keywords when provided.
      - [x] Empty state prompts user to select a card.
  - [x] Create deck statistics display
    - Acceptance criteria:
      - [x] Shows summary stats (total, unique, averages) and visualizations for cost, type, rarity.
      - [x] Handles empty deck state gracefully.
      - [x] Charts readable in light/dark themes (see `ChartThemeVars.tsx`).

- [ ] **Functionality**
- [ ] Implement card drag-and-drop
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - [x] Drag from card grid to deck list adds the card; dragging within deck reorders if supported.
    - [x] Visual drag feedback (cursor, hover/target highlight) and keyboard-accessible add/remove alternatives.
    - [x] Prevents invalid drops and respects deck constraints (max copies, hero cap, single non-neutral faction, deck size).
  - Work items (active):
    - [x] Wire drop handling to enforce constraints during drop in `DeckList.tsx`
    - [x] Add hover/target highlight on valid drop zones; provide keyboard alternative (e.g., Space to add)
    - [x] Optional: support intra-deck reorder via drag; add smoke tests for add/remove/reorder
- [x] Add deck validation rules
  - Notes: Enforced 30â€“50 card count, max 3 copies (1 for unique), and up to 2 non-neutral factions; drop guard blocks invalid additions.
- [x] Create deck import/export
  - Notes: Export via JSON download; Import added to `DeckBuilderInterface.tsx`.
- [x] Add deck sharing functionality
  - Notes: Backend shortlinks (`/api/decks/share`, `/api/decks/share/{id}`) and UI Share button; supports `s` param (short id) with `d` (base64 JSON) fallback.

- [ ] **Integration**
  - [x] Connect to card database
    - Notes: Backend `/api/cards/search` sources from `CARDS_SOURCE_URL` (or `CARDS_SOURCE_FILE`) with TTL cache; frontend `CardService` uses it transparently.
  - [x] Implement deck saving/loading (in-memory backend + UI save)
  - [x] Add deck versioning (increment on update in backend)
  - [x] Implement state synchronization
    - Notes: Server-authoritative sync over WebSocket (`/ws`) using `deck.subscribe`/`deck.update` with idempotency ids and server `seq`; client reconciles via `realtime:deck.state`.
  - [x] Add undo/redo functionality (context `past`/`future` + UI controls)

#### 2. Authentication Flow

- [ ] **Core Authentication**
  - [x] Implement email/password auth
  - [x] Add social login (Google, Discord)
  - [x] Set up JWT token handling
  - [ ] Implement password reset flow

- [ ] **User Management**
  - [ ] Create user profile system
  - [ ] Implement email verification
  - [ ] Add account settings
  - [ ] Set up user roles and permissions

- [ ] **Security**
  - [ ] Implement rate limiting
  - [ ] Add CSRF protection
  - [x] Set up session management
  - [ ] Configure CORS policies

#### 3. Game State Management

- [ ] **State Architecture**
  - [ ] Design game state schema
  - [ ] Implement state reducers
  - [ ] Create action creators
  - [ ] Set up state persistence

- [ ] **Game Logic**
  - [ ] Implement turn management
  - [ ] Create card effect system
  - [ ] Add win/lose conditions
  - [ ] Set up game history

- [ ] **Integration**
  - [ ] Connect to backend API
  - [ ] Add error handling
  - [ ] Implement state synchronization
  - [ ] Add undo/redo functionality

#### 4. Real-time Features

- [ ] **WebSocket Setup**
  - [x] Implement WebSocket server
  - [x] Create connection manager
  - [x] Add heartbeat/ping system
  - [x] Implement reconnection logic

- [ ] **Real-time Events**
  - [ ] Game state updates
  - [ ] Player actions/events
  - [ ] Chat messages
  - [ ] Notifications

- [ ] **Performance**
  - [ ] Implement message batching
  - [ ] Add rate limiting
  - [ ] Optimize payload size
  - [ ] Set up monitoring

##### Tracking

- [ ] Event schema documented (action names, payloads, versioning, idempotency keys)
- [ ] Transport chosen (WebSocket/SSE); reconnection backoff strategy defined
- [ ] Presence/heartbeat protocol and timeouts specified
- [ ] Client state sync model (server authority vs optimistic updates) agreed
- [ ] Error handling, retries, and outbox/inbox patterns documented

  - Work items (active):
    - [x] Decide transport (WebSocket) and draft event schema (`docs/technical/REALTIME_EVENT_SCHEMA.md`)
    - [x] Implement minimal connection manager with heartbeat and exponential backoff
    - [x] Define state sync strategy and idempotency keys (server authority, per-deck seq/idempotency)
    - [ ] Add monitoring hooks
