## Project Overview

Crisis Unleashed is a digital card game with blockchain integration, featuring seven unique factions with distinct mechanics. This document consolidates all planning and migration efforts into a single source of truth.

## Design Philosophy

### Hybrid UI Approach

- **Zero-Noise Core**: Clean, minimal interface emphasizing key information
- **Holographic Theme**: Immersive UI elements enhancing the sci-fi experience
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Advanced features revealed as players become comfortable
- **Tactical Depth**: Clear visualization of synergies and crisis events

## Implementation Status

### Completed Components

- âœ… Basic Next.js application structure
- âœ… React Query integration
- âœ… Feature flag system
- âœ… Core UI components (Button, Card, Badge, Alert)
- âœ… Faction system migration (cards, grid, details)
- âœ… Card browsing components
- âœ… Basic layout components
- âœ… Type-check baseline clean (frontend-next)
- âœ… Deck builder core UI (grid, list)

### In Progress

- ðŸ”„ Deck builder migration (polish & lint cleanup) â€” see active work items under Deck Builder Functionality
- ðŸ”„ Authentication system
- ðŸ”„ Game integration systems
- ðŸ”„ Real-time game status updates â€” see active work items under Real-time Features

### Quality and Tooling

- âœ” ESLint and TypeScript checks are clean (as of 2025-08-12)
- âœ” Markdown lint issues in this plan resolved (spacing/blank lines)
- âœ” Spell-check dictionary updated (cspell: Backstab)

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router

- Deck builder core UI (grid, list)

### Pending Migrations

#### 1. Deck Builder Interface

- [ ] **UI Components**
  - [x] Create card grid with filtering and search
  - [x] Implement deck list management
  - [x] Add card details panel
    - Acceptance criteria:
      - [ ] Shows name, type, faction, rarity badge, cost, description, and image when available.
      - [ ] Displays combat stats and keywords when provided.
      - [ ] Empty state prompts user to select a card.
  - [x] Create deck statistics display
    - Acceptance criteria:
      - [ ] Shows summary stats (total, unique, averages) and visualizations for cost, type, rarity.
      - [ ] Handles empty deck state gracefully.
      - [ ] Charts readable in light/dark themes.

 - [ ] **Functionality**
  - [ ] Implement card drag-and-drop
    - Acceptance criteria:
      - [ ] Drag from card grid to deck list adds the card; dragging within deck reorders if supported.
      - [ ] Visual drag feedback (cursor, hover/target highlight) and keyboard-accessible add/remove alternatives.
      - [ ] Prevents invalid drops and respects deck constraints from `useDeck()` (max quantity, faction/rules).
    - Work items (active):
      - [ ] Wire drop handling from `CardGrid.tsx`/`GameCard.tsx` into `DeckList.tsx` to call `useDeck().addCard()` with constraints
      - [ ] Add hover/target highlight on valid drop zones; provide keyboard alternative (e.g., Space to add)
      - [ ] Optional: support intra-deck reorder via drag; add smoke tests for add/remove/reorder
  - [ ] Add deck validation rules
  - [ ] Create deck import/export
  - [ ] Add deck sharing functionality

- [ ] **Integration**
  - [ ] Connect to card database
  - [ ] Implement deck saving/loading
  - [ ] Add deck versioning
  - [ ] Implement state synchronization
  - [ ] Add undo/redo functionality

#### 2. Authentication Flow

- [ ] **Core Authentication**
  - [ ] Implement email/password auth
  - [ ] Add social login (Google, Discord)
  - [ ] Set up JWT token handling
  - [ ] Implement password reset flow

- [ ] **User Management**
  - [ ] Create user profile system
  - [ ] Implement email verification
  - [ ] Add account settings
  - [ ] Set up user roles and permissions

- [ ] **Security**
  - [ ] Implement rate limiting
  - [ ] Add CSRF protection
  - [ ] Set up session management
  - [ ] Configure CORS policies

#### 3. Game State Management

  - [ ] Implement state reducers
  - [ ] Create action creators
  - [ ] Set up state persistence

- [ ] **Game Logic**
  - [ ] Implement turn management
  - [ ] Create card effect system
  - [ ] Add win/lose conditions
  - [ ] Set up game history
