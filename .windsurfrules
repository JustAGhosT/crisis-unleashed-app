## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.

The game system implements a turn-based card strategy game with the following core business components:

## Core Game Engine (Importance: 95)

- Centralized game state management in `GameInterface.tsx`
- Turn-based progression with alternating player actions
- Energy and momentum resource systems
- Automated state transitions and resource resets

## Turn Management (Importance: 90)

Located in `TurnManager.tsx`:

- Phase-based turn structure (DEPLOY, ACTION, END)
- Countdown timer integration
- Active phase highlighting
- Turn completion validation

## Card Management System (Importance: 85)

Implemented in `CardHand.tsx`:

- Energy-based card play validation
- Hand size management
- Card selection and targeting system
- Play condition verification

## Battlefield Control (Importance: 85)

Managed through `Battlefield.tsx`:

- Grid-based unit placement system
- Combat zone definitions (player/enemy areas)
- Unit interaction handling
- Battlefield state management

## Player Status System (Importance: 80)

Implemented in `PlayerHUD.tsx`:

- Health tracking
- Resource management (energy/momentum)
- Visual status representation
- Active player state indication

## Backend Integration (Importance: 75)

Server components in `server.py`:

- Status check management
- Game state persistence
- Unique identifier generation
- Timestamp-based state tracking

The system prioritizes core gameplay mechanics with clear separation between battlefield management, turn control, and resource systems, creating an integrated strategic experience.
