## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The Crisis Unleashed project implements a complex digital card game with blockchain integration, organized around several core business domains:

## Core Game Systems (Importance: 95)
- Turn-based gameplay with phase management
- Resource systems (Energy/Momentum)
- Crisis event system affecting gameplay state
- Combat resolution with positioning mechanics
- Located in: `frontend/src/features/battlefield/`

## Faction System (Importance: 90)
Seven unique factions with distinct mechanics:
- Solaris Nexus: Energy manipulation and prediction
- Umbral Eclipse: Stealth and information warfare
- Aeonic Dominion: Time manipulation
- Primordial Genesis: Growth and adaptation
- Infernal Core: Risk/reward sacrifice mechanics
- Neuralis Conclave: Mind control abilities
- Synthetic Directive: Mechanical optimization
Located in: `frontend/src/data/factions/`

## Blockchain Integration (Importance: 85)
- Transaction outbox pattern for NFT minting/trading
- Multi-chain support (Ethereum/Etherlink)
- Wallet integration and ownership verification
Located in: `backend/services/blockchain_service.py`

## Card Systems (Importance: 85)
- Faction-specific card mechanics
- Synergy visualization between cards
- Card ownership as NFTs
- Deck building with faction restrictions
Located in: `frontend/src/features/cards/`

## Feature Management (Importance: 80)
- Progressive feature rollout system
- Role-based feature access
- Feature state persistence
Located in: `frontend-next/src/lib/feature-flags/`

## Service Health Management (Importance: 75)
- Critical service monitoring
- Dependency-aware initialization
- Real-time health status tracking
Located in: `backend/services/health_manager.py`

The system integrates these components through a service-oriented architecture, with the blockchain service handling NFT operations, the game service managing gameplay state, and the frontend providing faction-specific interfaces and mechanics.
