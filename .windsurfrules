## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The NeuralLiquid game system implements a complex trading card game with blockchain integration, built around three core pillars:

## Faction System (85/100)
- Seven distinct factions with unique mechanics:
  - Solaris Nexus: Energy manipulation/prediction
  - Umbral Eclipse: Stealth/information warfare
  - Neuralis Conclave: Mind control mechanics
  - Aeonic Dominion: Time manipulation
  - Primordial Genesis: Growth/adaptation
  - Infernal Core: Risk-reward sacrifice
  - Synthetic Directive: Optimization systems

## Game State Management (85/100)
1. Turn Structure
- Three-phase system: Deploy/Action/End
- Dual resource management: Energy/Momentum
- Crisis event integration affecting gameplay state

2. Combat Resolution
- Zone-based positioning system
- Battlefield state tracking
- Crisis modifier application
- Faction-specific bonuses

## Blockchain Integration (75/100)
1. Multi-Chain NFT Operations
- Outbox pattern for transaction reliability
- Network-specific validation rules
- Chain-agnostic operation interface

2. Asset Management
- Faction-based NFT attributes
- Rarity system implementation
- Cross-chain asset tracking

Key Integration Points:
1. plans/board-game-interface.md: Core game mechanics
2. backend/services/blockchain_service.py: Chain integration
3. frontend/src/components/factions/FactionGrid.tsx: Faction UI system

The system's uniqueness comes from combining complex faction mechanics with blockchain-based asset management while maintaining game state consistency across distributed components.
