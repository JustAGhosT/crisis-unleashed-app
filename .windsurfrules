## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


Core Business Domain: Digital Card Game with Blockchain Integration

Primary Systems:

1. Faction Mechanics (85/100)
Path: frontend/src/services/factionService.ts
- Seven distinct factions with unique metaphysical approaches
- Dual-resource management (Energy/Momentum)
- Faction-specific ability mechanics and constraints
- Cross-faction synergy calculations

2. Blockchain Integration (90/100)
Path: backend/services/blockchain_handler.py
- Multi-chain NFT card minting system
- Transaction outbox pattern for reliable operations
- Chain-specific optimizations for Ethereum/Etherlink
- Marketplace integration for card trading

3. Deck Building Rules (85/100)
Path: frontend/src/services/deckService.ts
- Faction mixing limits (max 2 per deck)
- Card rarity distribution requirements
- Energy curve optimization system
- Synergy-based deck analysis
- Archetype identification algorithms

4. Crisis Event System (80/100)
Path: backend/workers/outbox_processor.py
- Dynamic battlefield modifiers
- Real-time event processing
- Multiple resolution paths
- Faction-specific crisis responses

5. Combat Resolution (75/100)
Path: frontend/features/battlefield/Battlefield.tsx
- Zone-based positioning system
- Initiative-based attack ordering
- Multi-step damage resolution
- Status effect tracking
- Line of sight calculations

The system integrates traditional card game mechanics with unique blockchain features and faction-based metaphysical concepts. Core business logic focuses on maintaining game balance across multiple factions while ensuring reliable blockchain operations for card ownership and trading.
