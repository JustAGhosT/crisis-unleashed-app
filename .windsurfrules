## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


CORE BUSINESS DOMAINS

1. Faction System (85/100)
- Seven distinct factions with unique mechanics and interactions
- Faction-specific resource manipulation and abilities
- Complex relationship system between factions
- Located in: frontend-next/src/lib/theme/faction-theme.ts

2. Deck Building Engine (90/100)
- Enforces deck construction rules:
  - 30-50 cards per deck
  - Maximum 3 copies per card (1 for legendaries)
  - Two faction limit per deck
  - Hero card requirements
- Validates faction compatibility and synergies
- Located in: frontend-next/src/services/deckService.ts

3. Blockchain Asset Management (85/100)
- NFT implementation of game cards with rarity encoding
- Cross-chain asset handling between networks
- Transaction outbox pattern for eventual consistency
- Located in: backend/services/blockchain_handler.py

4. Combat System (80/100)
- Hex-based battlefield with positioning rules
- Unit type-specific movement and attack patterns
- Resource management (Energy/Momentum)
- Located in: frontend-next/src/components/game/Battlefield.tsx

KEY INTEGRATIONS

1. Resource Management Hub
- Coordinates Energy and Momentum across systems
- Faction-specific modifiers and scaling
- Crisis event impact handling
- Located in: backend/app_types/faction.py

2. Card Mechanics Engine
- Implements type hierarchy (Hero, Unit, Action, Structure)
- Manages card abilities and interactions
- Handles rarity-based restrictions
- Located in: frontend-next/src/lib/card-utils.ts

The system implements a digital card game with unique faction-based mechanics, complex deck building rules, and blockchain-based asset management. Core business value derives from the intricate interaction between faction abilities, deck construction constraints, and strategic gameplay elements.
