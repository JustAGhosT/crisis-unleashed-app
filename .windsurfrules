## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


Core Game Architecture Components:

1. Faction System (Score: 90)
`backend/app_types/faction.py`
- Seven distinct factions with unique mechanics
- Energy/Momentum resource management 
- Faction relationship calculation system
- Cross-faction ability interactions
- Faction-specific combat modifiers

2. Card Mechanics Engine (Score: 85)
`frontend-next/src/lib/card-utils.ts`
- Card type hierarchy (Hero, Unit, Structure, Action)
- Combat resolution system
- Unit positioning and movement rules
- Ability trigger validation
- Resource cost calculations

3. Deck Construction Rules (Score: 80)
`frontend-next/src/services/deckService.ts`
- Maximum 3 copies per card
- 30-50 cards per deck requirement
- Two-faction maximum limit
- Hero card requirements
- Resource curve validation

4. Battlefield Manager (Score: 75)
`frontend-next/src/components/game/Battlefield.tsx`
- Hex-based combat grid
- Zone of control mechanics
- Unit movement validation
- Combat range calculations
- Terrain effect implementation

5. Game State Controller (Score: 70)
`backend/services/game_state.py`
- Phase-based turn system
- Resource accumulation rules
- Combat sequence management
- State transition validation
- Victory condition tracking

Integration Points:
- Faction system feeds into deck building constraints
- Card mechanics interact with battlefield positioning
- Resource system connects phases and actions
- Combat resolution combines unit stats with faction bonuses

The business logic emphasizes faction identity and mechanical interactions while maintaining game balance through interconnected systems of restrictions and bonuses.
